## Overview
This week focused on analyzing **marketing funnels and performance metrics** to understand how users move from first touch to completed ride at BimRide.  
The objective was to design a structured funnel framework, define consistent KPIs, and calculate metrics in a way that scales across channels, cities, and campaigns.

Rather than evaluating isolated campaigns, the emphasis was on building **repeatable analytical models** that marketing and growth teams can rely on for experimentation, forecasting, and budget allocation.

## Project Work (Step by Step)

### Part 1: Funnel Design and User Journey

#### Step 1: Mapping the End-to-End Funnel
- Defined core funnel stages from impression and click through signup, request, and completed ride.  
- Considered multiple acquisition sources including SEO, paid ads, referrals, and email.  
- Designed funnel layers that support both high-level executive reporting and granular channel analysis.  

#### Step 2: Standard Funnel Taxonomy
| **Funnel Stage** | **Description** | **Business Question Answered** |
|---|---|---|
| Awareness | Ad views / impressions | Are users discovering BimRide? |
| Acquisition | Clicks / site visits | Which channels drive traffic? |
| Activation | Signup / app install | Are users onboarding? |
| Conversion | First ride | Are users monetizing? |
| Retention | Repeat rides | Are users returning? |

- Focused on standardized definitions to ensure cross-team alignment.

### Part 2: Metrics and KPI Calculation

#### Step 3: KPI Selection Framework
- Identified north-star and supporting metrics such as conversion rate, cost per acquisition, lifetime value, and churn.

| CAC | Spend / new riders | Acquisition efficiency |
| LTV | Revenue per rider | Profitability |
| Drop-off Rate | Abandonment between stages | Friction detection |
| Channel ROI | Revenue / spend | Budget allocation |

- Ensured formulas were documented centrally and reused across reports and dashboards.

2. **Data Fragmentation** – Combining ad, web, app, and trip data sources.  
3. **Metric Inflation Risks** – Avoiding misleading vanity metrics.  
4. **Seasonality Effects** – Accounting for time-based demand swings.
