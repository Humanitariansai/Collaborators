# ðŸ“„ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) & BimRide Recommendation Systems

**ðŸ“… Date**: September 2nd, 2025  
**ðŸŽ¯ Objective**: Master K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm mathematics and implement similarity-based recommendation systems for BimRide's personalized customer experience

## ðŸ§  K-Nearest Neighbors Mathematical Foundation

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, powerful algorithm that makes predictions based on the similarity between data points. It assumes that similar instances have similar outcomes, making it ideal for recommendation systems and pattern recognition.

### **Core Mathematical Concepts:**

| **Component** | **Mathematical Definition** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|---|
| **Distance Metrics** | Various methods to measure similarity | Determine nearest neighbors |
| **Euclidean Distance** | d = âˆšÎ£(xi - yi)Â² | Most common distance measure |
| **Manhattan Distance** | d = Î£|xi - yi| | Alternative for high-dimensional data |
| **Cosine Similarity** | cos(Î¸) = (AÂ·B)/(||A|| ||B||) | Measures angular similarity |
| **K Parameter** | Number of neighbors to consider | Controls prediction smoothness |

### **Algorithm Process:**
1. **Calculate distances** between query point and all training points
2. **Sort distances** and select K nearest neighbors
3. **For Classification**: Use majority vote of K neighbors
4. **For Regression**: Use average of K neighbor values
5. **Weight by distance** (optional) for closer neighbor influence

## ðŸš€ Distance Metrics for BimRide Applications

### **Customer Similarity Measures:**

**Feature Vector Example:**
```
Customer Profile = [
    ride_frequency,      // Rides per month
    avg_trip_distance,   // Average kilometers
    preferred_time,      // Hour of day (0-23)
    price_sensitivity,   // Budget category (1-5)
    service_rating,      // Average rating given
    location_preference  // Geographic zone
]
```

**Distance Calculation:**
```python
def customer_similarity(customer1, customer2):
    # Weighted Euclidean distance
    weights = [0.3, 0.2, 0.15, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05]
    distance = 0
    for i in range(len(customer1)):
        distance += weights[i] * (customer1[i] - customer2[i])**2
    return sqrt(distance)
```

### **Similarity Metrics for Different Use Cases:**

| **Application** | **Distance Metric** | **Reasoning** |
|---|---|---|
| **Customer Preferences** | Weighted Euclidean | Accounts for feature importance |
| **Route Similarity** | Haversine Distance | Geographic accuracy |
| **Time Patterns** | Cosine Similarity | Handles cyclical time data |
| **Service Ratings** | Manhattan Distance | Robust to outliers |

## ðŸ“Š BimRide KNN Applications

### **Customer Recommendation Engine:**

**Problem:** Recommend services to customers based on similar customer preferences

**Implementation:**
1. **Find K similar customers** based on ride history and preferences
2. **Identify services** used by similar customers
3. **Rank recommendations** by frequency and satisfaction scores
4. **Personalize suggestions** based on customer context

**Business Value:**
- **Increased Revenue**: Cross-selling and upselling opportunities
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Relevant, personalized service suggestions
- **Retention**: Enhanced customer engagement through tailored experiences
- **Efficiency**: Automated recommendation generation

### **Driver-Customer Matching:**

**Matching Algorithm:**
```python
def find_best_driver(customer_profile, available_drivers, k=5):
    similarities = []
    for driver in available_drivers:
        # Calculate compatibility score
        score = calculate_compatibility(customer_profile, driver.profile)
        similarities.append((driver, score))
    
    # Select top K most compatible drivers
    best_matches = sorted(similarities, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:k]
    
    # Weight by additional factors (location, rating, availability)
    final_score = apply_business_logic(best_matches)
    return final_score[0][0]  # Return best driver
```

### **Route Optimization Through Similarity:**

| **Route Feature** | **Similarity Measure** | **Optimization Goal** |
|---|---|---|
| **Historical Success** | Past route performance | Minimize travel time |
| **Traffic Patterns** | Time-based similarity | Avoid congestion |
| **Customer Preferences** | Route type preferences | Maximize satisfaction |
| **Driver Expertise** | Driver-route familiarity | Ensure smooth experience |

## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced KNN Implementation

### **Dynamic K Selection:**

**Adaptive K Algorithm:**
- **Dense Areas**: Use larger K for stable predictions
- **Sparse Areas**: Use smaller K to avoid oversmoothing
- **Cross-Validation**: Optimize K for different customer segments
- **Business Context**: Adjust K based on decision importance

**K Selection Formula:**
K_optimal = min(sqrt(n), max(3, n/segment_size))

Where n = number of similar customers, segment_size = customer category size

### **Weighted KNN for Business Context:**

**Distance Weighting:**
w(d) = 1/dÂ² (inverse distance squared)

**Feature Importance Weighting:**
- **Recent Behavior**: Higher weight (0.4)
- **Frequency Patterns**: Medium weight (0.3)
- **Satisfaction History**: Medium weight (0.2)
- **Demographics**: Lower weight (0.1)

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Optimization

### **Computational Efficiency:**

| **Technique** | **Purpose** | **Performance Gain** |
|---|---|---|
| **KD-Trees** | Fast nearest neighbor search | 10x faster for low dimensions |
| **Locality Sensitive Hashing** | Approximate nearest neighbors | 100x faster for high dimensions |
| **Feature Selection** | Reduce dimensionality | Improved accuracy and speed |
| **Data Preprocessing** | Normalize and scale features | Better distance calculations |

### **Real-Time Implementation:**

**Caching Strategy:**
- **Pre-compute** similarities for frequent customer types
- **Update incrementally** as new data arrives
- **Cache popular** recommendations for quick access
- **Lazy evaluation** for infrequent queries

## ðŸ”— Business Intelligence Applications

### **Market Segmentation:**

**Customer Clustering Using KNN:**
1. **Identify prototype customers** for each segment
