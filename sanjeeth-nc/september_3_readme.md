# ðŸ“„ Support Vector Machines (SVM) & BimRide Advanced Classification

**ðŸ“… Date**: September 3rd, 2025  
**ðŸŽ¯ Objective**: Master Support Vector Machine mathematics and implement robust classification systems for BimRide's complex business decision-making and pattern recognition

## ðŸ§  Support Vector Machine Mathematical Foundation

Support Vector Machines (SVM) find optimal decision boundaries by maximizing the margin between different classes. This geometric approach creates robust classifiers that work well with complex, high-dimensional data typical in business applications.

### **Core Mathematical Concepts:**

| **Component** | **Mathematical Definition** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|---|
| **Hyperplane** | wÂ·x + b = 0 | Decision boundary in feature space |
| **Margin** | 2/||w|| | Distance between classes |
| **Support Vectors** | Points closest to hyperplane | Critical data points defining boundary |
| **Kernel Function** | K(xi, xj) | Transform data to higher dimensions |
| **Regularization (C)** | Controls overfitting vs. underfitting | Balance complexity and accuracy |

### **Optimization Problem:**

**Primal Form:**
Minimize: Â½||w||Â² + Câˆ‘Î¾i

Subject to: yi(wÂ·xi + b) â‰¥ 1 - Î¾i, Î¾i â‰¥ 0

**Dual Form (Lagrangian):**
Maximize: âˆ‘Î±i - Â½âˆ‘âˆ‘Î±iÎ±jyiyjK(xi,xj)

Subject to: âˆ‘Î±iyi = 0, 0 â‰¤ Î±i â‰¤ C

## ðŸš€ Kernel Functions for Business Applications

### **Kernel Types and Applications:**

| **Kernel** | **Mathematical Form** | **BimRide Use Case** |
|---|---|---|
| **Linear** | K(xi,xj) = xiÂ·xj | Simple classification problems |
| **Polynomial** | K(xi,xj) = (Î³xiÂ·xj + r)^d | Non-linear customer behavior |
| **RBF (Gaussian)** | K(xi,xj) = exp(-Î³||xi-xj||Â²) | Complex pattern recognition |
| **Sigmoid** | K(xi,xj) = tanh(Î³xiÂ·xj + r) | Neural network-like decisions |

### **Kernel Selection Strategy:**

**RBF Kernel for Customer Behavior:**
```python
# Customer satisfaction prediction
def rbf_kernel(x1, x2, gamma=0.1):
    distance_squared = sum((a - b)**2 for a, b in zip(x1, x2))
    return exp(-gamma * distance_squared)

# Automatic gamma selection
gamma_optimal = 1 / (n_features * variance_of_features)
```

**Business Interpretation:**
- **Small Î³**: Smooth decision boundary (underfit risk)
- **Large Î³**: Complex boundary (overfit risk)
- **Optimal Î³**: Balance between complexity and generalization

## ðŸ“Š BimRide SVM Applications

### **Customer Quality Classification:**

**Problem:** Classify customers into value tiers for service personalization

**Feature Engineering:**
```python
customer_features = [
    'monthly_ride_frequency',    # Usage intensity
    'average_trip_value',        # Spending level
    'rating_consistency',        # Service satisfaction
    'payment_reliability',       # Financial trustworthiness
    'loyalty_duration',          # Relationship length
    'referral_generation',       # Network value
    'complaint_frequency'        # Service issues
]
```

**Classification Targets:**
- **Premium Customers**: High value, high satisfaction
- **Standard Customers**: Regular usage, moderate value
- **At-Risk Customers**: Declining engagement patterns

### **Fraud Detection System:**

**Anomaly Classification:**
```python
fraud_indicators = [
    'booking_pattern_deviation',  # Unusual timing/frequency
    'payment_method_changes',     # Frequent payment updates
    'location_inconsistencies',   # Geographic anomalies
    'rapid_account_creation',     # Suspicious account behavior
    'price_manipulation_attempts', # Gaming system attempts
    'driver_rating_patterns'      # Unusual rating behavior
]
```

**SVM Advantages for Fraud Detection:**
- **High Precision**: Minimize false fraud accusations
- **Robust to Outliers**: Handle unusual but legitimate behavior
- **Interpretable Boundaries**: Understand decision logic
- **Real-Time Performance**: Fast classification for live transactions

## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced SVM Implementation

### **Multi-Class Classification:**

**One-vs-Rest Strategy:**
- Build separate binary classifiers for each class
- Choose class with highest confidence score
- Suitable for well-separated classes

**One-vs-One Strategy:**
- Build classifiers for each pair of classes
- Use voting mechanism for final prediction
- Better for overlapping classes

### **Imbalanced Data Handling:**

| **Technique** | **Implementation** | **BimRide Application** |
|---|---|---|
| **Class Weighting** | Adjust C parameter by class frequency | Handle rare fraud cases |
| **SMOTE Integration** | Generate synthetic minority samples | Increase rare customer types |
| **Threshold Tuning** | Adjust decision boundary | Optimize precision/recall balance |
| **Cost-Sensitive Learning** | Different misclassification costs | Business-aware error costs |

### **Feature Scaling and Preprocessing:**

**Standardization:**
z = (x - Î¼) / Ïƒ

**Min-Max Normalization:**
x_norm = (x - x_min) / (x_max - x_min)

**Robust Scaling:**
x_robust = (x - median) / IQR

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Optimization and Tuning

### **Hyperparameter Optimization:**

**Grid Search Parameters:**
```python
param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000],
    'gamma': ['scale', 'auto', 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1],
    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf', 'poly'],
    'degree': [2, 3, 4, 5]  # for polynomial kernel
}
```

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Area under receiver operating characteristic curve

### **Cross-Validation Strategy:**

| **CV Method** | **Use Case** | **BimRide Context** |
|---|---|---|
| **Stratified K-Fold** | Balanced class representation | Customer type classification |
| **Time Series Split** | Temporal data validation | Historical pattern recognition |
| **Group K-Fold** | Customer-based splitting | Avoid data leakage |
| **Leave-One-Out** | Small dataset validation | High-value customer analysis |
