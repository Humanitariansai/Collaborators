# Daily Progress Report – October 31, 2025

## Overview
Today I studied **API throttling at client-side**, focusing on how apps prevent spamming the backend with excessive requests. This is important because mobile apps often trigger multiple events unintentionally—scrolling, dragging, or background polling.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed Client-Side Throttling Techniques**
I explored:
- debounce  
- throttle  
- batching on client  

These avoid overwhelming servers.

### **2. Studied Mobility-Specific Patterns**
Driver apps often send:
- location updates  
- battery level  
- availability status  

Throttling prevents unnecessary bandwidth usage.

### **3. Tested Client-Side Limits**
I experimented with:
- sending location every 3–5 seconds  
- only sending updates if movement > X meters  
- batching UI analytics  

This reduces noise.

### **4. Designed Bimride Client Throttling Rules**
Possible rules:
- rider app: suppress redundant ETA updates  
- driver app: limit GPS updates indoors  
- dashboard: reduce analytics polling

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Lower Backend Strain**
Client throttling drastically reduces API traffic.

### **2. Battery-Friendly for Drivers**
Lower GPS frequency saves battery during long shifts.

### **3. Better Performance in Low-Signal Areas**
Fewer requests = fewer failures.

### **4. Long-Term Reliability**
Client discipline reduces infrastructure costs and improves stability.
