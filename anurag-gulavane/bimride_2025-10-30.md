# Daily Progress Report – October 30, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **mobile offline-first design**, understanding how apps stay responsive even without network connectivity. Barbados has zones with inconsistent connectivity, so Bimride must remain usable offline.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Offline Caching**
I reviewed:
- local storage  
- SQLite on-device caching  
- service workers for web views  

Offline caching helps riders and drivers continue interacting with the app.

### **2. Explored Sync Strategies**
I studied:
- delta sync  
- conflict resolution  
- background uploads  

These keep data consistent once connectivity returns.

### **3. Designed Offline UI States**
Examples:
- “Offline mode” with last known driver locations  
- cached ride history  
- default pricing guidelines  
- trip receipts stored locally  

This improves user experience in weak-signal areas.

### **4. Planned Offline-First Features for Bimride**
Ideas include:
- drivers can still mark availability  
- riders can view cached hotspots  
- app preloads common routes  
- retry-queue for actions taken offline
