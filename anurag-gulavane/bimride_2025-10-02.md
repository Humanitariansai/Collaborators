# Daily Progress Report – October 2, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **database sharding**, specifically how splitting data across multiple servers improves scalability and reliability. While Bimride will start in Barbados, long-term expansion will require structuring data so it can handle regional growth, increased ride volume, and high tourism seasons.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Vertical vs Horizontal Sharding**
Vertical sharding splits data by feature (users, trips, payments).  
Horizontal sharding splits by rows (e.g., riders by region).

I realized mobility platforms almost always use **horizontal sharding** due to massive trip logs and location updates.

### **2. Explored Shard Keys**
Choosing a shard key defines performance.  
I studied common keys like:
- user_id  
- region code  
- driver_id  

For Bimride, region-based sharding makes sense once the platform expands to other islands.

### **3. Learned About Rebalancing**
I reviewed how systems like Vitess or CockroachDB move shards when traffic grows.  
Bimride will eventually need automatic balancing during peak tourism seasons.

### **4. Designed Shard Strategy for Bimride**
I drafted:
- single-shard architecture for Barbados  
- multi-shard architecture for multi-island expansion  
- archival shard for old trip logs  

This helped me envision a future-proof data system.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Supports Multi-Island Growth**
Sharding ensures Bimride scales cleanly as new markets open.

### **2. Improves Performance During Surges**
Trip logs and route updates won’t overwhelm a single database node.

### **3. Lowers Costs**
Sharded data avoids the need for expensive monolithic database servers.

### **4. Ensures Long-Term Reliability**
With sharding, Bimride’s infrastructure won’t collapse under heavy traffic.
