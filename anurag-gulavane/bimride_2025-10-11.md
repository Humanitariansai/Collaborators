# Daily Progress Report – October 11, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **distributed caching**, especially how platforms use systems like Redis and Memcached to reduce database load and speed up repeated queries. This is important for Bimride because mobility platforms constantly fetch similar data: nearby drivers, recent trips, regional pricing, and routing lookups.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Cache Invalidation Strategies**
I learned about:
- time-based expiration  
- write-through caching  
- cache-aside patterns  
- forced eviction policies  

This clarified how Bimride should keep cached data fresh without overloading the backend.

### **2. Explored Redis Data Structures**
I reviewed:
- sorted sets for geo queries  
- hashes for user profiles  
- strings for simple lookups  
- pub/sub for real-time events  

Redis’ versatility maps well to Bimride’s needs.

### **3. Tested Geo-Indexing in Redis**
I practiced using `GEOADD` and `GEORADIUS` commands, which immediately made me realize how Redis can help approximate nearest drivers quickly before hitting PostGIS.

### **4. Designed a Distributed Cache Layout for Bimride**
Key cached elements:
- ETA results  
- pricing estimates  
- frequently requested routes  
- driver availability  
- hotspot locations  

This makes the system more responsive and less dependent on repeated database queries.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Reduces Backend Load**
Caching absorbs frequent requests, making Bimride faster.

### **2. Improves Rider and Driver Experience**
Instant ETAs and prices build trust.

### **3. Supports Barbados’ Network Conditions**
Fewer backend trips = fewer failures in low-signal zones.

### **4. Lowers Infrastructure Costs**
Caching avoids unnecessary database scaling.
