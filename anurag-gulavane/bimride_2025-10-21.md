# Daily Progress Report – October 21, 2025

## Overview
Today I studied **NoSQL databases**, focusing on their strengths in handling flexible schemas and high write volumes. Mobility platforms generate massive streams of semi-structured data that sometimes fit better in NoSQL storage.

## Activities
### **1. Compared SQL vs NoSQL Models**
I explored:
- document stores  
- wide-column databases  
- key–value stores  
- graph databases  

Each solves different scaling problems.

### **2. Studied Real-Time Write Workloads**
I reviewed how systems like MongoDB or Cassandra handle:
- high-frequency driver updates  
- continuous event logs  
- flexible trip metadata  

These workloads map well to mobility.

### **3. Explored Hybrid Use Cases**
Bimride might use:
- SQL for core rides, users, drivers  
- NoSQL for location logs and analytics events  

This hybrid model offers both structure and flexibility.

### **4. Designed Possible NoSQL Uses for Bimride**
Examples:
- storing driver location history  
- real-time heatmap data  
- temporary surge pricing snapshots  
- caching routing engine hints  
This clarified where NoSQL fits naturally.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Better Handling of High-Volume Data**
Driver location streams fit perfectly into NoSQL.

### **2. Faster Analytics**
Semi-structured data enables rapid experimentation.

### **3. Lower Storage Costs**
NoSQL handles large datasets cheaply compared to relational databases.

### **4. Flexible Feature Development**
As Bimride evolves, NoSQL enables quick iteration on new data-heavy features.
