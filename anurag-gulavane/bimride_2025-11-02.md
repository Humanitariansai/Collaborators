# Daily Progress Report – November 2, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **pricing algorithms**, understanding how mobility platforms compute base fare, per-mile fees, surge multipliers, and time-based adjustments. Pricing is core to Bimride’s business model and fairness perception.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Common Pricing Models**
I analyzed:
- distance-based pricing  
- time-based pricing  
- hybrid models  
- minimum fares  

This forms the foundation of Bimride’s pricing strategy.

### **2. Explored Surge Algorithms**
I reviewed:
- demand vs supply ratio  
- zone-based surge  
- predictive surge models  

These help maintain service availability.

### **3. Designed a Simple Pricing Formula**
Example:
```
final_price = base + (dist * rate_per_km) + (time * rate_per_min) * surge
```

### **4. Considered Local Context for Barbados**
I accounted for:
- tourism-heavy peaks  
- local wage levels  
- fuel pricing  
- typical trip durations
