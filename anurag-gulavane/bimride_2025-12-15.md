# Daily Progress Report – December 15, 2025

## Overview
Today focused on modeling the **trip lifecycle** as a first-class backend concept. The objective was to ensure that every trip progresses through well-defined states that remain consistent across distributed services.

By treating trip state as a formal system rather than ad-hoc flags, the platform can better handle retries, partial failures, and recovery scenarios.

---

## Activities

### 1. Defined Trip State Boundaries
Outlined clear stages such as request, match, enroute, active, completed, and cancelled, with explicit transition rules.

---

### 2. Identified State Ownership
Assigned authoritative ownership of trip state to a single backend service to avoid race conditions and conflicting updates.

---

### 3. Evaluated Failure Scenarios
Analyzed how trips should behave when services fail mid-transition.

---

## How This Ties to Bimride
A robust trip lifecycle model is essential for reliability, billing accuracy, and rider trust.

---

## Reflection
Explicit state machines reduce ambiguity and make failure handling predictable.
