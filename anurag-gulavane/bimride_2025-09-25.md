# Daily Progress Report – September 25, 2025

## Overview
Today’s focus was on understanding **rate limiting and throttling techniques**, crucial for keeping mobility platforms stable when user requests spike. Barbados may see sudden surges during rainstorms, concerts, or cruise ship arrivals — Bimride must remain responsive during these moments.

## Activities

### **1. Studied Popular Rate-Limiting Algorithms**
I learned the differences between:
- Token Bucket  
- Leaky Bucket  
- Fixed Window  
- Sliding Window  

Each balances fairness, burst handling, and accuracy differently.

### **2. Analyzed Real Surges in Ride-Hailing Systems**
I studied examples where mobility apps crashed during peak times.  
This helped me understand how Bimride must handle sudden bursts of:
- price estimate requests  
- ETA lookups  
- driver location updates  
- repeated ride requests

### **3. Designed Throttling Rules for Bimride**
Potential rules include:
- limiting driver location updates per minute  
- capping repeated price requests  
- throttling duplicate ride requests  
- preventing spam from misbehaving clients

### **4. Studied API Gateway Enforcement**
Gateways like Kong, Traefik, and Envoy handle throttling at scale.  
This taught me the correct layers where Bimride should apply limits.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride

### **1. Surge Protection**
Rate limiting ensures Bimride remains stable even during sudden spikes.

### **2. Fairness**
Every rider retains equal access to the platform, even during high-demand periods.

### **3. Cost Control**
Limiting excessive requests prevents unnecessary autoscaling.

### **4. Platform Reliability**
A strong rate-limiting strategy makes Bimride resilient, predictable, and trustworthy.
