# Daily Progress Report – October 28, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **schema migrations and database evolution**, studying how mobility platforms evolve data structures over time as features grow. Safe migrations are critical for uptime and data integrity.

---

## Activities
### **1. Studied Migration Tools**
I reviewed:
- Flyway  
- Liquibase  
- Prisma migrations  
- Django migrations  

These automate safe schema evolution.

### **2. Explored Zero-Downtime Migration Patterns**
Key patterns:
- expand → migrate → contract  
- dual writes during transition  
- background backfills  

Mobility data requires careful rollout.

### **3. Practiced Designing Migration Scripts**
I drafted:
- adding surge multiplier column  
- splitting driver table into profiles + status  
- creating pricing_logs archive table  

This exercise highlighted common patterns.

### **4. Created Migration Rules for Bimride**
Rules:
- never drop columns without audit  
- always backfill in small batches  
- version every schema change  
- test migrations against production-like dataset

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Ensures Safe Feature Rollouts**
Migrations enable Bimride to add features without breaking existing users.

### **2. Prevents Data Corruption**
Carefully planned changes protect trip and pricing records.

### **3. Supports Long-Term Growth**
As Bimride expands, schema evolution becomes constant.

### **4. Enables Cleaner Architecture**
Gradual schema refactors keep technical debt low.
