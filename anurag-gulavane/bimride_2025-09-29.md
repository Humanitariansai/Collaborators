# Daily Progress Report – September 29, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **ACID transactions and data consistency** in databases. Mobility platforms constantly update driver locations, modify trip states, and handle payments — so understanding transactional guarantees is essential for reliability.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed ACID Properties**
I revisited:
- **Atomicity**: ride state updates must fully complete or fully fail  
- **Consistency**: pricing and trip logs must remain accurate  
- **Isolation**: multiple drivers accepting the same ride cannot conflict  
- **Durability**: completed trips must never disappear  

These concepts directly map to Bimride’s data needs.

### **2. Studied Isolation Levels**
I analyzed:
- Read Uncommitted  
- Read Committed  
- Repeatable Read  
- Serializable  

Serializable is safest but slowest. Mobility systems usually choose Repeatable Read for balance.

### **3. Explored Race Conditions in Mobility Apps**
Examples:
- two drivers trying to accept the same ride  
- rider canceling at the exact moment the driver accepts  
- price changing during request  

Understanding these helped me see why transactions and locking strategies matter.

### **4. Designed Transaction Flows for Bimride**
For example:
- ride creation → atomic insert  
- driver acceptance → conditional update with locks  
- payment → multi-step transaction  
These mapped cleanly into Bimride’s real-world behaviors.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Prevents Ride Assignment Bugs**
Proper isolation ensures only one driver can accept a ride.

### **2. Ensures Trust in Pricing & Payments**
Transactions ensure money movements and price logs remain accurate.

### **3. Improves Platform Reliability**
Consistency prevents data corruption during peak usage.

### **4. Supports Regulatory Requirements**
Accurate, durable trip logs help Bimride work with tourism authorities and government partners.
