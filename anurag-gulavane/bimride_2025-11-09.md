## Overview
Today I focused on **mobile sensor fusion and location reliability**, a topic that directly affects Bimride’s real-time tracking accuracy for both riders and drivers. While GPS is the primary source of location data, relying on it alone can produce large inaccuracies—especially in island environments like Barbados. Buildings near Bridgetown, tree cover in rural areas, narrow streets, and coastline reflections create multipath errors that distort raw GPS readings. To address this, modern mobility platforms use *sensor fusion*: combining GPS with accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and sometimes barometer readings to produce a far more stable and reliable trajectory. 

Understanding this topic required me to dive into how different sensors complement each other, how noise models behave, how Kalman filters fuse signals together, and how mobility apps decide when to trust or distrust certain measurements. I wanted to connect all of this to Bimride’s concrete use cases—like predicting driver approach, updating ETAs, positioning vehicles on narrow roads, improving safety, and reducing rider anxiety.

The entire session revealed how nuanced real-time positioning really is. It’s not simply “take GPS and display it”—it’s about intelligently smoothing motion, recovering from bad signals, detecting when someone is stationary or moving, snapping routes to the right part of the road, and ensuring Bimride’s experience feels polished and accurate even on low-end devices.

## Activities

### 1. Studied Limitations of Mobile GPS
GPS on phones is noisy. I spent part of the day analyzing how:
- tall buildings cause reflections that “bounce” signals
- cloud cover and humidity can distort readings near coastlines
- Barbados’ mix of hilly terrain and dense vegetation affects visibility
- older devices have slower satellite acquisition
- driver phone mounts may obstruct GPS sensors

In mobility apps, these issues cause drivers to appear:
- slightly off the road
- on the wrong street
- further away than they actually are
- to “jump” unpredictably on the map  

Riders often interpret this as the driver being lost, even when they’re literally in front of them. Understanding this helped me see why sensor fusion is essential for Bimride’s reliability.

### 2. Explored IMU Sensors: Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer
The phone's IMU (inertial measurement unit) provides motion data that complements GPS:
- **Accelerometer** detects changes in speed and direction.
- **Gyroscope** captures rotational changes—useful for turns.
- **Magnetometer** gives heading direction, though sometimes noisy.
- **Barometer** (if available) can detect altitude changes.

I studied how mobility apps use these sensors to:
- determine movement even when GPS is stale
- detect sudden stops (driver braking)
- estimate curves or turns when GPS is noisy
- interpolate position between GPS samples

This allows smoother, more accurate tracking—critical for Bimride’s ETA predictions.

### 3. Learned the Basics of Kalman Filtering & Sensor Fusion
Kalman Filters (KF) combine multiple noisy signals into a single optimal estimate.  
I broke the concept down into practical components:
- **Prediction step:** Where do we expect the driver to be based on previous motion?
- **Update step:** How does new sensor data adjust that prediction?
- **Covariance:** How confident are we in the current estimate?
- **Noise modeling:** Which sensor is more trustworthy at a given moment?

For example:
- If GPS suddenly shifts 20 meters due to reflection, but IMU indicates stable motion, KF will reject the GPS jump.
- If the driver accelerates, IMU detects it before GPS updates.
- If the driver loses GPS briefly, KF predicts motion until data returns.

This system dramatically reduces map jitter—exactly what Bimride needs.

### 4. Modeled Real-World Barbados Driving Scenarios
To ground the theory, I created scenarios based on Barbados roads:

**Scenario A: Bridgetown narrow streets**
- GPS multipath errors common.
- KF should rely more on IMU + previous motion for continuity.

**Scenario B: Rural St. Andrew with patchy signal**
- GPS may drop entirely.
- KF predicts movement using IMU alone.
- Once GPS returns, KF blends it gradually to avoid jumps.

**Scenario C: Airport pickup zones**
- High noise due to buildings, cars, movement.
- KF smooths rapid direction changes and prevents false drifting.

These scenarios helped me see how sensor fusion directly affects user trust.

### 5. Designed a Sensor Fusion Pipeline for Bimride
I drafted the pipeline Bimride could use:

1. **Collect raw sensor data:**
   - GPS every 1–3 seconds  
   - IMU readings at ~30–60 Hz  

2. **Normalize timestamp differences**  
   Align data to a common timeline.

3. **Apply noise filtering**  
   Remove obvious outliers (e.g., unrealistic jumps).

4. **Kalman Filter fusion**  
   Combine GPS + IMU into a stable trajectory.

5. **Map matching**  
   Snap final fused path to the road network.

6. **State classification:**  
   - moving  
   - slowing  
   - stopped  
   - turning  
   - idling  

7. **Optimization for battery usage**  
   Reduce IMU sampling when stationary.

8. **Send updates to Bimride backend**  
   Only send fused, stable data.

This pipeline ensures smooth, reliable tracking.

### 6. Studied Battery and Performance Concerns
Sensor fusion is powerful but expensive:
- IMU reads frequently  
- KF runs continuously  
- Map matching costs CPU  

I examined strategies to balance accuracy and battery:
- disable high-frequency IMU when driver is stopped
- reduce GPS frequency during consistent road segments
- preload map tiles for local processing
- batch upload fused data instead of sending every point

This reduces battery drain for drivers, which directly affects retention.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride

### 1. Far More Accurate Driver Tracking
Sensor fusion produces stable movement that:
- stops jitter  
- removes zig‑zag effects  
- corrects GPS drift  
- produces smooth animations  

This makes Bimride feel premium and trustworthy.

### 2. Dramatically Improved ETAs
Bad GPS = bad ETAs.  
Fused data improves:
- route calculations  
- real-time predictions  
- rider wait times  
- pickup precision  

This translates directly to better user satisfaction.

### 3. Higher Driver Efficiency
Accurate positioning reduces:
- missed turns  
- failed pickups  
- rerouting delays  

Drivers complete more trips with less frustration.

### 4. Better Experience for Tourists
Visitors depend heavily on clear, reliable tracking.  
Cleaner motion reduces anxiety and improves perception of safety.

### 5. Strong Competitive Advantage
Local taxi systems cannot match sensor-fusion-level accuracy.  
This becomes a USP for Bimride.

### 6. Foundation for Advanced Features
Sensor fusion enables:
- high-resolution trip playback  
- road quality analytics  
- turn prediction  
- driving behavior scoring  
- intelligent pickup-point recommendations  

The entire pipeline becomes a core pillar of Bimride’s technical identity.
