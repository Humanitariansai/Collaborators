# Daily Progress Report – October 9, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **API rate fairness and multi-tenant quota systems**, understanding how platforms allocate resources between different user groups fairly. 
This is critical for Bimride as both riders and drivers interact constantly with the backend.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed Fairness Models**
I explored:
- Weighted fairness  
- Proportional fairness  
- Priority queues  
These help distribute system capacity logically.

### **2. Studied Mobility-Specific Request Patterns**
Riders generate:
- ETA requests  
- price checks  
- trip creation  

Drivers generate:
- location updates  
- accept/decline actions  

Both must be balanced fairly.

### **3. Designed Multi-Tenant Quotas for Bimride**
Examples:
- drivers get higher location-update quota  
- riders get stable price-check quota  
- admin dashboards get low quota  

This ensures predictable performance.

### **4. Explored Abuse Prevention**
I learned how quota systems stop:
- spam requests  
- scraping  
- ride manipulation  
This protects Bimride’s backend.

No user group overwhelms the backend.

### **2. Improves Platform Stability**
Quota rules prevent sudden overloads during rush hours.

### **3. Protects Against Abuse**
Fair-use models strengthen platform security.

### **4. Enhances User Trust**
Stable performance makes Bimride feel reliable and professional.
