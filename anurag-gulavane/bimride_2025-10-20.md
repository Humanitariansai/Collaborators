# Daily Progress Report – October 20, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **API pagination and data batching**, understanding how large datasets can be delivered efficiently without overwhelming clients or servers. Mobility apps deal with trip histories, driver logs, pricing data, and analytics—so efficient data delivery is essential.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Pagination Strategies**
I reviewed:
- offset-based pagination  
- cursor-based pagination  
- keyset pagination  

Cursor-based pagination is ideal for real-time datasets like ride logs.

### **2. Explored Batch Processing**
I learned how batching reduces server load by grouping multiple operations:
- bulk inserts for trip logs  
- grouped notifications  
- analytics batch jobs  

Batching improves throughput significantly.

### **3. Learned About Data Windows**
I explored time-windowed data pulls like:
- last 24 hours  
- last 50 trips  
- last 10 location updates  

Mobility platforms frequently use rolling windows to optimize load.

### **4. Designed Pagination Schemes for Bimride**
Possible areas:
- trip history  
- driver performance reports  
- hotspot analytics  
- customer support dashboards  

This created a clear blueprint for scalable data retrieval.
