# Daily Progress Report – September 28, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **network latency and performance optimization**, especially how mobile apps must handle inconsistent connection speeds. Barbados has zones with strong connectivity and others where signal strength fluctuates—understanding these constraints is key for Bimride.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Latency Components**
I reviewed:
- DNS lookup time  
- TCP handshake time  
- SSL negotiation  
- payload transfer  
- server processing time  
Understanding these pieces helped me analyze where Bimride can reduce delays.

### **2. Learned About Connection Reuse**
I studied how keep-alive connections and HTTP/2 multiplexing reduce overhead.  
This is extremely valuable for mobile users who constantly open and close the app.

### **3. Tested Methods for Reducing Payload Size**
I looked into:
- gzip/brotli compression  
- minified JSON  
- reducing repeated fields  
- binary formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers)  
Smaller payloads = faster responses = smoother ride-request flow.

### **4. Designed a Latency-Reduction Plan for Bimride**
Key ideas:
- preload essential data  
- cache responses aggressively  
- optimize route-fetching endpoints  
- use shorter JSON keys where possible  
- adopt HTTP/2 for speed  
This exercise helped me see how Bimride could perform better than informal taxis or small local apps.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Smoother Rider and Driver Experience**
Reduced latency means less waiting, fewer failed requests, and more trust.

### **2. Resilience in Low-Signal Areas**
Optimized payloads and connections allow the app to function even at the island’s connectivity edges.

### **3. Better Competitive Advantage**
A faster, smoother app outperforms both traditional taxis and any local competitors.

### **4. Supports Future Real-Time Features**
Analytics dashboards, live driver positioning, and smart routing all depend on low-latency systems.
