# Daily Progress Report – December 23, 2025

## Overview
Work centered on **concurrency control** in pricing and dispatch workflows where multiple requests may compete for shared resources.

---

## Activities

### 1. Identified Race Conditions
Analyzed scenarios where simultaneous requests could lead to inconsistent pricing outcomes.

---

### 2. Designed Concurrency Guards
Introduced locking and versioning strategies to ensure deterministic results.

---

### 3. Evaluated Performance Impact
Balanced correctness guarantees with latency constraints.

---

## How This Ties to Bimride
Concurrency-safe pricing prevents disputes, refunds, and erosion of trust.

---

## Reflection
Correctness under concurrency is a prerequisite for scale.
