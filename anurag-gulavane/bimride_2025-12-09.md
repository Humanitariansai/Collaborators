# Daily Progress Report – December 9, 2025

## Overview
Today focused on analyzing data flow between rider, driver, and dispatch services to reduce latency and avoid unnecessary synchronous dependencies.

---

## Activities

### 1. Mapped Critical Data Paths
Identified latency-sensitive paths such as driver location updates and dispatch decisions.

---

### 2. Evaluated Async vs Sync Communication
Determined where asynchronous messaging could safely replace synchronous calls without harming consistency.

---

### 3. Identified Bottlenecks
Flagged areas where excessive round-trips could degrade rider experience.

---

## How This Ties to Bimride
Reducing latency directly improves pickup accuracy and rider trust, especially in high-traffic zones.

---

## Reflection
Low latency is often achieved more through architectural restraint than raw computation power.
