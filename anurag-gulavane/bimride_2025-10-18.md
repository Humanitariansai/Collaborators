# Daily Progress Report – October 18, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **real-time communication protocols**, particularly how rider-driver updates propagate instantly. 
Mobility apps rely heavily on real-time location updates, ride status changes, and pricing events.

## Activities
### **1. Compared WebSockets vs Long Polling**
I analyzed:
- persistent connections  
- server push  
- bandwidth usage  
- reconnection logic  

WebSockets are ideal for continuous driver location updates.

### **2. Studied MQTT and Event-Driven Messaging**
MQTT provides lightweight pub/sub communication, perfect for low-bandwidth environments like rural Barbados.

### **3. Tested Real-Time Events Locally**
I simulated:
- ride accepted → event to rider  
- driver moving → location stream  
- price changed → event notification  

This highlighted latency considerations.

### **4. Designed Real-Time Channels for Bimride**
Channels include:
- driver → rider updates  
- surge alerts  
- ride lifecycle events  
- driver availability broadcasts  

These ensure the app feels alive and responsive.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Smooth Rider Experience**
Instant updates reduce uncertainty and waiting anxiety.

### **2. Faster Driver Decision-Making**
Real-time requests allow drivers to accept rides quickly.

### **3. Better System Awareness**
Live data powers analytics, pricing, and routing engines.

### **4. Strong Competitive Advantage**
Local taxis can’t match real-time transparency.
