# Daily Progress Report – October 7, 2025

## Overview
Today’s focus was on **frontend performance optimization**, specifically how mobile web views and app clients can be made extremely fast. For a mobility app, even a few hundred milliseconds of delay affects rider trust and driver efficiency.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Rendering Optimization**
I analyzed:
- virtual DOM diffing  
- layout thrashing  
- GPU acceleration  
This taught me how to keep Bimride’s frontend smooth even on older phones.

### **2. Explored Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**
Splitting bundles ensures riders see the app interface instantly without waiting for entire scripts to load.

### **3. Learned About Image Optimization**
I reviewed:
- WebP formats  
- responsive images  
- compression strategies  
Barbados’ network variability makes image efficiency essential.

### **4. Designed a Frontend Performance Checklist for Bimride**
Key items:
- minified assets  
- pre-connect to API domains  
- aggressive caching  
- reduced JavaScript payload  
- skeleton screens for ride request UI  

This clarified how the app can feel snappy at all times.
