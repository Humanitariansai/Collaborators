# Daily Progress Report – October 27, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **SQL query optimization**, learning how to detect slow queries, analyze execution plans, and rewrite SQL to perform efficiently. Mobility platforms frequently query trip histories, driver data, and real-time information.

## Activities
### **1. Studied EXPLAIN Plans**
I learned how query planners:
- choose indexes  
- perform sequential scans  
- filter rows  
- sort/aggregate data  

This helped me understand database performance bottlenecks.

### **2. Explored Query Rewrite Techniques**
I practiced:
- replacing subqueries with joins  
- limiting selected columns  
- using covering indexes  
- avoiding wildcards  

Even small optimizations lead to major performance gains.

### **3. Analyzed Common Mobility Queries**
Examples:
- “find nearest available drivers”  
- “load last 20 trips”  
- “fetch pricing history for a zone”  

These queries must be fast and predictable.

### **4. Designed Optimization Checklist for Bimride**
The checklist includes:
- never sort unindexed columns  
- avoid unnecessary DISTINCT  
- paginate always  
- ensure WHERE clauses use indexes

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Faster Trip Retrieval**
Optimized queries load histories instantly.

### **2. Improved Driver Matching**
Efficient DB queries reduce latency in finding nearby drivers.

### **3. Lower Hosting Costs**
Less CPU time = reduced database bills.

### **4. Strong Backend Reliability**
Performance tuning reduces timeouts during peak periods.
