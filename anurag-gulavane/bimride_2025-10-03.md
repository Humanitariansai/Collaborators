# Daily Progress Report – October 3, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **API monitoring and observability**, understanding how logs, metrics, and traces create visibility into system behavior. Mobility platforms must detect slowdowns, API failures, and regional outages instantly.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Observability Pillars**
I reviewed the three core components:
- **Logs** for event history  
- **Metrics** for numerical trends  
- **Traces** for end-to-end request flow  

Together, they allow engineers to diagnose failures quickly.

### **2. Reviewed Tools & Techniques**
I learned how platforms use:
- Prometheus for metrics  
- Grafana for dashboards  
- OpenTelemetry for tracing  
- Loki/Elastic for logs  

These tools form the backbone of modern monitoring.

### **3. Explored Mobility-Specific Metrics**
Bimride needs custom metrics like:
- driver location update latency  
- ride matching time  
- routing engine response time  
- pricing engine load  
- failed ride requests  

These metrics provide actionable insights.

### **4. Designed a Monitoring Setup for Bimride**
I drafted:
- dashboards for real-time ride flow  
- alerts for API slowdowns  
- traces for route calculations  
- logs for driver device failures  

This clarified the importance of strong visibility.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Faster Issue Detection**
Monitoring lets Bimride identify failures before users notice them.

### **2. Higher Uptime**
Data-driven alerts reduce downtime during peak tourism periods.

### **3. Better Rider and Driver Trust**
Stable, responsive systems feel more professional and reliable.

### **4. Strong Engineering Culture**
Observability encourages clean debugging and consistent backend health.
