# Daily Progress Report – October 22, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **vector databases and similarity search**, understanding how embeddings and high-dimensional search can support recommendation systems, fraud detection, and intelligent routing heuristics.

## Activities
### **1. Learned About Embeddings**
Embeddings convert:
- locations  
- behavior patterns  
- text (support messages)  
into vectors.

This unlocks smarter analysis.

### **2. Studied Vector Indexes**
I reviewed:
- HNSW  
- IVF  
- PQ (Product Quantization)  
These indexes make high-dimensional search fast.

### **3. Explored Use Cases for Mobility Apps**
Vector search can help:
- recommend pickup points  
- detect fraudulent accounts  
- cluster driver behaviors  
- forecast hotspot growth  

This connects ML directly to mobility.

### **4. Designed Vector-Based Features for Bimride**
Examples:
- personalized ride hotspots  
- driver efficiency scoring  
- smart routing hints  
- anomaly detection in trips  

This made vector databases feel applicable beyond ML research.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Smarter Recommendations**
Better pickup suggestions increase rider satisfaction.

### **2. Stronger Fraud Detection**
Vector patterns reveal suspicious accounts and behaviors.

### **3. Improved Routing Intelligence**
Embedding-based heuristics help routing adapt to real behavior.

### **4. Future-Ready Architecture**
Vector search positions Bimride for advanced AI-driven features.
