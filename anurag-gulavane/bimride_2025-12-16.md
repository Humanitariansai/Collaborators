# Daily Progress Report – December 16, 2025

## Overview
Work today examined **idempotency and retry behavior** in unstable network environments, a common condition for mobile mobility platforms.

---

## Activities

### 1. Designed Idempotent APIs
Ensured repeated requests would not cause duplicated side effects.

---

### 2. Defined Retry Semantics
Established safe retry windows and timeout thresholds.

---

### 3. Evaluated Consistency Guarantees
Balanced strong consistency with system responsiveness.

---

## How This Ties to Bimride
Idempotent design prevents double charges, phantom trips, and driver confusion.

---

## Reflection
Retries are inevitable; correctness depends on how systems respond to them.
