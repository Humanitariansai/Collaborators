# Daily Progress Report – October 12, 2025

## Overview
Today I studied **OAuth 2.0 and third‑party authorization**, focusing on how Bimride might integrate external identity providers or enable limited-access tokens for partners like tourism apps or hotel booking services.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed OAuth Roles**
I explored:
- resource owner  
- client application  
- authorization server  
- resource server  

This helped me understand where Bimride fits in the OAuth flow.

### **2. Explored Grant Types**
I studied:
- authorization code  
- client credentials  
- device flow  
- refresh tokens  

Each applies to different Bimride use cases.

### **3. Designed Partner Integration Scenarios**
Examples:
- Hotels requesting ride estimates on behalf of guests  
- Tourism apps embedding Bimride ride requests  
- Corporate accounts generating employee travel tokens  

OAuth enables controlled, secure integrations.

### **4. Considered Security & Scope Management**
I studied how scopes limit third-party access:
- read-only trip history  
- price estimation only  
- limited-time ride creation  

This prevents misuse and maintains user privacy.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Enables Tourism Ecosystem Integration**
OAuth allows Bimride to collaborate with hotels, airports, cruise lines, and tour operators.

### **2. Strengthens Security**
Scoped tokens ensure third parties only access what is necessary.

### **3. Expands Bimride’s Reach**
Embedding Bimride into partner platforms boosts adoption.

### **4. Future-Proofs the Platform**
OAuth-based architecture supports long-term ecosystem development.
