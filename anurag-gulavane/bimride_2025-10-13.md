# Daily Progress Report – October 13, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **log aggregation and centralized logging**, understanding how mobility platforms collect logs from multiple services and analyze them in one place. This is crucial for debugging and observing rider-driver behavior patterns.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed Log Aggregation Tools**
I studied:
- Elastic Stack (ELK)  
- Loki + Grafana  
- Datadog Logs  
Each offers powerful search and filtering capabilities.

### **2. Explored Log Structures**
I analyzed:
- JSON logs  
- structured fields  
- trace IDs  
- log levels  

Structured logs make multi-service debugging far easier.

### **3. Designed a Logging Pipeline for Bimride**
Pipeline idea:
- services emit logs to a collector  
- collector forwards logs to storage  
- dashboards visualize ride flow anomalies  

This helps maintain operational insight.

### **4. Studied PII Handling**
Mobility platforms must avoid logging:
- names  
- phone numbers  
- exact pickup addresses  

Understanding redaction is vital for Bimride’s privacy standards.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Easier Debugging**
Centralized logs make tracking failures across services simple.

### **2. Better Operational Awareness**
Patterns in logs reveal regional outages or slowdowns.

### **3. Stronger User Privacy**
PII-safe logs build trust with riders and regulatory bodies.

### **4. Improved Reliability**
Clear logs help Bimride resolve issues quickly during tourism peaks.
