# Daily Progress Report – October 17, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **encryption in transit and at rest**, understanding how mobility apps protect sensitive data flowing across networks and stored in databases. 
Security is foundational for Bimride, especially with rider information, driver data, payment logs, and location traces.

## Activities
### **1. Studied TLS Handshakes**
I reviewed:
- certificate exchange  
- symmetric key generation  
- encryption negotiations  

Understanding TLS helps ensure Bimride’s API traffic remains secure even on unstable networks.

### **2. Compared Data-at-Rest Encryption Approaches**
I analyzed:
- full-disk encryption  
- table-level encryption  
- column-level encryption  

For Bimride, column-level encryption is crucial for fields like phone numbers and payment details.

### **3. Explored Key Management Systems**
I learned how KMS solutions rotate, store, and protect encryption keys:
- AWS KMS  
- HashiCorp Vault  

This ensures Bimride never stores keys insecurely.

### **4. Designed Encryption Layers for Bimride**
Examples:
- TLS 1.3 for all API traffic  
- hashed & salted passwords  
- encrypted phone numbers  
- encrypted trip-history fields  

This created a realistic security plan.
