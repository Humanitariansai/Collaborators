# Daily Progress Report – October 5, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **distributed systems fundamentals**, focusing on why mobility platforms must handle partial failures, network delays, and inconsistent state across services. Even though Bimride will start small, understanding distributed thinking early prevents architectural problems later.

## Activities
### **1. Studied CAP Theorem**
I revisited how systems must choose between:
- Consistency  
- Availability  
- Partition Tolerance  
Bimride’s real-time nature means it must prioritize availability while gracefully handling temporary inconsistencies.

### **2. Explored Real-World Mobility System Failures**
I studied cases where routing engines went down or pricing services lagged.  
This revealed how important redundancy, caching, and graceful degradation are.

### **3. Practiced Designing a Minimal Distributed Architecture**
I drafted:
- dedicated routing service  
- separate pricing engine  
- isolated trip-management service  
Connected via lightweight events to reduce coupling.

### **4. Learned Techniques for Handling Partial Failure**
I reviewed:
- retries  
- fallbacks  
- circuit breakers  
- idempotency keys  
These ensure seamless ride creation even when one microservice stutters.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Provides a Fault-Tolerant Backbone**
Distributed thinking ensures Bimride doesn’t collapse if a single system fails.

### **2. Enables Smooth Scaling**
Decoupled services scale independently as demand fluctuates.

### **3. Reduces User-Visible Errors**
Fallbacks prevent riders from seeing failures during peak hours.

### **4. Supports Future Multi-Island Architecture**
Distributed principles help Bimride expand across the Caribbean with resilient infrastructure.
