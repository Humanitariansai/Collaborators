# Daily Progress Report – October 19, 2025

## Overview
Today I studied **A/B testing and experimentation frameworks**, especially how to evaluate changes to pricing, UI, and routing strategies. 
Experimentation is essential for tuning Bimride’s growth and understanding rider behavior.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed Controlled Experiment Basics**
I studied:
- control vs variant groups  
- random assignment  
- statistical significance  
- confidence intervals  

This helps measure whether a new feature truly improves metrics.

### **2. Learned About Experimentation Metrics**
Mobility apps track:
- acceptance rate  
- request-to-ride conversion  
- driver earnings  
- ETA satisfaction  

These metrics drive Bimride’s decision-making.

### **3. Designed Example Experiments for Bimride**
Experiments might include:
- showing surge pricing differently  
- testing alternate route suggestions  
- varying driver incentive notifications  
- UI adjustments for ride-request speed  

Each experiment reveals user behavior patterns.

### **4. Explored Feature Flagging Systems**
I reviewed:
- gradual rollouts  
- kill switches  
- cohort targeting  

This ensures experiments won’t disrupt the whole user base.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Data-Driven Growth**
Experimentation helps Bimride improve features based on real user behavior.

### **2. Higher Rider Conversion**
A/B tests refine UI and pricing strategies that increase ride requests.

### **3. Improved Driver Engagement**
Testing different incentive structures reveals what keeps drivers active.

### **4. Lower Risk of Bad Releases**
Feature flags protect the platform from widespread failures.
