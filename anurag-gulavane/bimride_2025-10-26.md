# Daily Progress Report – October 26, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **error handling strategies in distributed systems**, particularly how services communicate failures gracefully. Mobility platforms experience unpredictable network conditions, device-level interruptions, and partial backend issues—so robust error management is essential.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed Error Classification**
I studied:
- client errors (4xx)  
- server errors (5xx)  
- network/transient errors  
- business logic errors  

Understanding categories helps define proper responses.

### **2. Explored Retry Logic & Backoff Strategies**
I reviewed:
- linear backoff  
- exponential backoff  
- jitter  
These prevent thundering herd problems during outages.

### **3. Practiced Designing Error Payloads**
I created structured errors:
```
{
  "code": "DRIVER_TIMEOUT",
  "message": "Driver location delayed",
  "retryable": true
}
```
This helps clients take appropriate actions.

### **4. Drafted Bimride Error Philosophy**
Key ideas:
- never expose internal details  
- always provide actionable messages  
- treat network instability as normal  
- log errors consistently
