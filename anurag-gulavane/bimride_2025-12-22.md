# Daily Progress Report – December 22, 2025

## Overview
Today focused on designing **region-aware pricing architecture** that can support heterogeneous demand patterns without hard-coding assumptions into the system.

The goal was to ensure pricing logic remains configurable, testable, and predictable as Bimride expands across diverse zones.

---

## Activities

### 1. Abstracted Pricing Rules
Separated pricing rules from core dispatch logic to allow regional customization.

---

### 2. Identified Pricing Inputs
Documented inputs such as distance, time, congestion, region type, and demand signals.

---

### 3. Evaluated Maintainability Risks
Reviewed how pricing complexity could grow without proper abstractions.

---

## How This Ties to Bimride
Region-aware pricing supports fairness and sustainability across urban, tourist, and rural zones.

---

## Reflection
Flexible systems age better than optimized-but-rigid ones.
