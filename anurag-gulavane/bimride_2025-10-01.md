# Daily Progress Report – October 1, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **spatial databases and geospatial indexing**, especially how platforms store and query location-based data. This is essential for locating drivers, calculating ETAs, and mapping demand zones.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Geospatial Data Types**
I reviewed:
- POINT  
- LINESTRING  
- POLYGON  
Understanding these helped me map Barbados roads and driver locations mentally.

### **2. Learned About R-Tree Indexes**
R-Trees optimize spatial queries like:
- drivers within radius  
- nearby hotspots  
- region-based pricing  

These are core operations for ride-hailing platforms.

### **3. Explored PostGIS**
I studied how PostGIS extends PostgreSQL with spatial functions:
- ST_Distance  
- ST_Within  
- ST_Intersects  
These operations power real-time mapping.

### **4. Designed Spatial Queries for Bimride**
Examples:
- find drivers within 2 km  
- check if pickup is inside a zone  
- calculate distance between rider and driver  
These queries form the heart of Bimride’s matching engine.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Faster Driver Matching**
Spatial indexes allow near-instant lookup of nearby drivers.

### **2. Better ETA Accuracy**
Real-time geospatial operations improve route calculations.

### **3. Supports Smart Pricing**
Region-based pricing depends on spatial queries.

### **4. Creates a Strong Mapping Foundation**
Spatial indexing ensures Bimride grows with accurate maps and efficient routing.
