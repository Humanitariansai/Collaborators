# Daily Progress Report – November 3, 2025

## Overview
Today I studied **routing heuristics and shortest path algorithms**, especially how mobility apps compute driving routes efficiently. Barbados’ smaller road network still requires fast routing due to narrow roads and one-way streets.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed Dijkstra and A\* Algorithms**
I studied:
- edge relaxation  
- priority queues  
- heuristic functions  

A* is ideal for real-world routing.

### **2. Explored Real-World Routing Constraints**
Mobility-specific constraints include:
- turn penalties  
- traffic patterns  
- seasonal road closures  
- narrow rural paths  

These constraints must be encoded in the routing engine.

### **3. Built a Small Routing Simulation**
I tested:
- graph construction  
- heuristic design  
- shortest-path queries  

This clarified performance requirements.

### **4. Drafted Bimride Routing Engine Needs**
Requirements include:
- caching repeated routes  
- hybrid A* + heuristic scoring  
- fallback routing  
- dynamic re-routing during a trip

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Faster ETAs**
Efficient routing makes ETA predictions reliable.

### **2. Better Driver Efficiency**
Optimized routes reduce fuel and time costs.

### **3. Improved Rider Satisfaction**
Accurate paths prevent confusing detours.

### **4. Scalable Routing Architecture**
Smarter heuristics reduce server load and cost.
