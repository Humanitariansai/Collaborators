# Daily Progress Report – December 17, 2025

## Overview
Focused on designing **graceful degradation paths** when partial system outages occur.

---

## Activities

### 1. Identified Critical vs Non-Critical Functions
Separated must-have functionality from optional enhancements.

---

### 2. Designed Fallback Behavior
Defined system responses when dependent services are unavailable.

---

### 3. Evaluated User Impact
Considered how degraded modes affect rider and driver experience.

---

## How This Ties to Bimride
Graceful degradation preserves core functionality and trust during incidents.

---

## Reflection
A partially working system is often better than a fully unavailable one.
