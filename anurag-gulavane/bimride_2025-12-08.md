# Daily Progress Report – December 8, 2025

## Overview
Today’s work focused on defining core backend service boundaries for Bimride’s mobility platform. The goal was to establish a system architecture that scales cleanly as demand grows while minimizing coupling between critical services.

Rather than thinking in terms of features, the work centered on capability ownership—determining which services should own routing decisions, pricing computation, identity validation, and trip state transitions.

## Activities

### 1. Identified Core Platform Services
Outlined the primary backend services required for a real-time mobility platform:
- Rider Service  
- Driver Service  
- Dispatch & Matching Service  
- Routing & ETA Service  
- Pricing & Incentives Service  
- Identity & Safety Service  

Each service was defined by responsibility rather than implementation, reducing future refactoring risk.

---

### 2. Analyzed Coupling Risks
Evaluated how excessive inter-service dependencies could introduce cascading failures, latency amplification, and complex debugging paths.

---

### 3. Defined Data Ownership Principles
Established clear ownership boundaries to prevent conflicting state updates and ambiguous authority across services.

---

## How This Ties to Bimride
This work lays the foundation for a scalable, fault-tolerant backend architecture that can support island-wide and future multi-island expansion.

---

## Reflection
Early architectural clarity reduces long-term complexity far more effectively than post-hoc optimization.
