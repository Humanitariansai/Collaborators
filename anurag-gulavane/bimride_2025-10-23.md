# Daily Progress Report – October 23, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **API schema design and contract validation**, focusing on how mobility platforms ensure that all clients—rider apps, driver apps, dashboards—communicate correctly with backend services. Strong schemas prevent data corruption and reduce production bugs.

## Activities
### **1. Studied OpenAPI and JSON Schema**
I reviewed how OpenAPI defines:
- endpoints  
- request bodies  
- response formats  
- error models  

Schemas make APIs self-documenting and consistent.

### **2. Explored Contract Testing**
I learned how tools verify that services adhere to API contracts:
- consumer-driven tests  
- mock servers  
- automatic schema validation  

This reduces integration issues between teams.

### **3. Designed Error Models**
I experimented with structured errors like:
- `BAD_REQUEST`  
- `LOCATION_UNAVAILABLE`  
- `DRIVER_NOT_FOUND`  

These help clients respond predictably.

### **4. Drafted Bimride’s API Contract Style**
I designed conventions for:
- naming fields  
- timestamps  
- pagination fields  
- versioned routes  

This helps keep Bimride’s APIs clean and scalable.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Reduces Production Bugs**
Strong schemas prevent malformed requests.

### **2. Improves Developer Velocity**
Clear contracts make it easier for future engineers to build features.

### **3. Enhances App Stability**
Predictable request/response flows reduce rider/driver-side crashes.

### **4. Supports Long-Term Scaling**
Consistent schema design allows Bimride to evolve without breaking older clients.
