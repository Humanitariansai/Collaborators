# Daily Progress Report – October 14, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **fault tolerance and graceful degradation**, studying how systems continue operating even when parts of the platform fail. 
For a mobility service like Bimride, reliability during partial outages is essential—drivers still need to work, riders still need updates, and the system must remain usable.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Fault-Tolerant Design Patterns**
I reviewed:
- bulkheads  
- circuit breakers  
- retries with backoff  
- timeouts  
- fallback responses  

These patterns help isolate failures so they don’t crash the entire system.

### **2. Explored Graceful Degradation**
I studied how apps switch to reduced functionality when services go down:
- cached ETAs  
- approximate pricing  
- limited ride history  
This prevents total outage.

### **3. Analyzed Mobility Outage Case Studies**
Large ride-hailing companies sometimes lose a subsystem (e.g., payments, routing).  
Understanding these cases helped me see how Bimride should protect core functions.

### **4. Designed Degradation Scenarios for Bimride**
Examples:
- If routing fails → show cached routes  
- If pricing fails → show base fare  
- If driver updates lag → show last known location  

This helps keep the platform operational.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Higher Platform Reliability**
Users experience fewer interruptions even when internal issues occur.

### **2. Builds User Trust**
If Bimride feels dependable, riders and drivers stick with it.

### **3. Critical During Tourism Peaks**
Partial failures during high demand would otherwise harm reputation.

### **4. Long-Term Operational Stability**
Fault tolerance becomes part of Bimride’s engineering DNA.
