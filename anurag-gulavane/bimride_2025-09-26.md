# Daily Progress Report – September 26, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on understanding **load balancing**—how incoming requests are distributed across multiple servers to ensure stability, performance, and reliability. My goal was to connect classic CS load balancing concepts to how Bimride would operate during predictable peaks such as weekend nightlife in Bridgetown or sudden tourist surges.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Load Balancing Algorithms**
I explored:
- Round Robin  
- Weighted Round Robin  
- Least Connections  
- IP Hash  
- Latency-based balancing  
Learning how each one decides which server to route a request to helped me understand which strategies are most appropriate for a mobility platform.

### **2. Learned About Health Checks and Failover**
I examined how load balancers constantly probe backend services:
- `/health` endpoints  
- latency thresholds  
- failover rules  
- automatic traffic rerouting  
This is essential because any downtime for routing, pricing, or trip creation directly impacts user trust.

### **3. Explored Global vs Regional Load Balancing**
Even though Bimride will operate first in Barbados, understanding regional routing matters if the platform grows into other islands such as St. Lucia or Trinidad.  
I studied DNS-based routing, geographic latency routing, and multi-region availability.

### **4. Designed a Load Balancing Approach for Bimride**
I drafted a system where:
- API gateway handles request routing  
- internal services use least-connections  
- routing and pricing engines get weighted priority due to higher CPU requirements  
This helped me visualize how Bimride should be architected for long-term reliability.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Stability During High Demand**
Load balancing prevents overload when many riders request ETAs or prices simultaneously, keeping the platform responsive.

### **2. Supporting Tourism Peaks**
Cruise arrivals, concerts, and holidays create temporary spikes—balancing ensures smooth handling.

### **3. Cost Efficiency**
Balanced traffic means fewer surprise compute spikes and more predictable cloud spending.

### **4. Foundation for Multi-Island Expansion**
Load balancing is essential once Bimride expands beyond Barbados, allowing services to remain stable across locations.
