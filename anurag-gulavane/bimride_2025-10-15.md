# Daily Progress Report – October 15, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **containerization and Docker fundamentals**, focusing on how mobility platforms package services for consistent deployment. 
Containers are essential for shipping Bimride’s backend components efficiently.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed How Containers Work**
I studied:
- images  
- layers  
- registries  
- container runtime behavior  

Understanding these helped me visualize how Bimride’s services can be isolated and reproducible.

### **2. Explored Dockerfile Optimization**
I learned best practices:
- using minimal base images  
- multi-stage builds  
- caching dependencies  
- reducing layer count  

This makes builds faster and images smaller.

### **3. Practiced Containerizing a Small API**
I wrote a simple Dockerfile and deployed a test service locally.  
This made containerization feel straightforward and practical.

### **4. Designed a Container Layout for Bimride**
Possible services:
- routing  
- pricing  
- trip management  
- notification engine  
- auth service  

Each packaged as its own container, orchestrated by Kubernetes or Nomad.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Consistent Deployments**
Containers ensure Bimride behaves the same across all environments.

### **2. Faster Scaling**
Services can be replicated instantly during demand spikes.

### **3. Reduced Deployment Errors**
Isolated environments prevent dependency conflicts.

### **4. Foundation for microservices**
Containers allow Bimride’s architecture to grow organically and cleanly.
