# Daily Progress Report – October 4, 2025

## Overview
Today’s focus was **hashing and data integrity**, especially how hashing ensures secure data storage, fast lookup, and tamper-proof logs. Mobility platforms rely heavily on hashing for user authentication, data validation, and consistent caching.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed Hashing Algorithms**
I studied:
- SHA-256  
- bcrypt  
- Argon2  
- MD5 (and why it shouldn’t be used)  
This helped me understand how Bimride should secure user passwords and sensitive logs.

### **2. Explored Hash Tables in Practice**
Hash tables enable:
- fast user lookups  
- quick ride retrieval  
- efficient caching keys  

These data structures appear everywhere in mobility systems.

### **3. Learned About Integrity Checks**
I reviewed how hashing ensures data isn't tampered with.  
Trip logs, payment histories, and route decisions must be protected from manipulation.

### **4. Designed Hash Usage for Bimride**
Use cases include:
- password storage  
- API signing  
- consistent caching  
- fraud detection  
- data integrity verification  

This showed how hashing plays a foundational role.
