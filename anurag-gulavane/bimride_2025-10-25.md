# Daily Progress Report – October 25, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **API gateway design**, understanding how gateways manage authentication, rate limiting, routing, observability, and request transformation. 
For Bimride, the gateway becomes the guardrail protecting all internal services.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed Gateway Responsibilities**
I studied:
- authentication  
- routing  
- SSL termination  
- caching  
- request validation  
- rate limiting  

Gateways simplify backend logic.

### **2. Explored Kong, Traefik & Envoy**
I compared:
- plugin ecosystems  
- performance  
- configuration styles  

These tools form the industry standard.

### **3. Practiced Designing Routing Rules**
Examples:
- `/rider/*` → rider service  
- `/driver/*` → driver service  
- `/pricing/*` → pricing engine  
- `/routing/*` → routing engine  

Clean routing creates separation of concerns.

### **4. Drafted Bimride Gateway Blueprint**
Features include:
- token verification  
- quota enforcement  
- response compression  
- A/B testing hooks  
- global rate limiting  

This makes the gateway a central reliability layer.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Protects Internal Services**
Gateways shield microservices from unwanted traffic.

### **2. Ensures Consistent Security**
Uniform auth prevents weak points.

### **3. Enables Smooth Scaling**
Routing and traffic shaping help Bimride stay responsive.

### **4. Simplifies Development**
Teams can build services without re-implementing common logic.
