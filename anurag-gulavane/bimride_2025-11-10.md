## Overview
Today I focused on **dynamic pricing engines**, specifically how mobility platforms compute real-time fares that adapt to changing conditions like demand, driver availability, traffic, weather, and special events. While Bimride already has a conceptual pricing model, I spent today designing a more advanced, production-level architecture—one capable of supporting the unique economic and environmental patterns of Barbados.

Barbados isn’t a massive metropolitan area like New York or London. Instead, its mobility dynamics are influenced by:
- tourism seasonality  
- cruise ship arrivals  
- airport rushes during peak flight windows  
- nightlife clusters like St. Lawrence Gap  
- sporadic traffic jams in Bridgetown  
- unpredictable weather shifts  

A rigid pricing system cannot handle this complexity. We need a pricing engine that is **real-time**, **predictive**, **context-aware**, and **transparent** to both riders and drivers. Today’s work centered on building that system conceptually, tying together data ingestion, fare computation, surge multipliers, heatmaps, and fairness constraints.

## Activities

### 1. Studied how major platforms compute dynamic fares
I began by analyzing how companies like Uber, Lyft, Bolt, and Didi calculate fares:
- Base fare  
- Per-minute rate  
- Per-kilometer rate  
- Surge multiplier  
- Minimum fare enforcement  
- Cancellation policies  
- Regional variations  

Though the formula looks simple, the complexity lies in **where the multiplier comes from** and **how often it updates**.

### 2. Modeled data ingestion pipelines for pricing inputs
To calculate accurate fares, Bimride must ingest:
- driver availability  
- rider request density  
- historical traffic speeds  
- GPS-based travel times  
- weather data  
- local event schedules  
- airport/port arrivals  

I designed a pipeline where:
- raw data enters Kafka topics  
- pricing service consumes updates  
- heatmaps and ratios are recalculated every 30–90 seconds  
- cached results are sent to rider/driver apps  

This ensures near-real-time accuracy.

### 3. Constructed the demand-supply ratio engine
Dynamic pricing is fundamentally about *balancing supply and demand*.

I defined:
- **Demand** = number of incoming ride requests  
- **Supply** = number of active drivers  

Ratio = demand / supply

Example:
- 50 requests / 10 drivers → ratio = 5 → surge likely  
- 20 requests / 40 drivers → ratio = 0.5 → no surge  

I then applied smoothing factors to avoid wild fluctuations.

### 4. Mapped Barbados into pricing zones
Because Barbados is small (430 km²), dynamic pricing cannot use giant grids. Instead, I divided the island into:
- airport zone  
- cruise harbor  
- Bridgetown core  
- Holetown  
- Oistins  
- St. Lawrence Gap  
- university zones  
- rural zones  

Each zone has:
- independent demand-supply models  
- unique surge patterns  
- local features (e.g., nightlife, shopping)  

This creates hyper-local accuracy.

### 5. Explored predictive surge modeling
Real-time pricing isn’t enough. Bimride needs predictive power:
- if a cruise ship docks at noon, surge begins at 11:45  
- if a rainstorm starts at 5 PM, demand spikes at 5:02  
- if a concert ends at 10 PM, surge appears at 9:50  

Predictive surge uses:
- historical patterns  
- weather API data  
- event calendars  
- ML-based demand curves  

I designed a simple model with weighted time-series averaging.

### 6. Built a transparent fare breakdown model
Pricing must be transparent:
- base fare  
- distance  
- time  
- surge (if any)  
- taxes and fees  

Users distrust platforms where surge seems arbitrary.  
For Bimride:
- show a clear breakdown  
- explain surge reason (e.g., “high demand near Bridgetown”)  
- show wait-time improvements due to surge  

Transparency improves trust.

### 7. Modeled fairness constraints
Dynamic pricing should be fair:
- cap surge multipliers (no 10× nonsense)  
- prevent surge on essential routes  
- smooth sudden spikes  
- prevent predatory pricing during emergencies  

I designed guardrails:
- max surge 2.5×  
- essential zones capped lower  
- surge decays smoothly over 10–15 minutes instead of instantly dropping  

This protects riders while ensuring drivers are fairly compensated.

### 8. Created a driver incentive tie-in
Instead of relying solely on surge pricing, I designed alternative incentives:
- driver bonuses in low-supply zones  
- guaranteed minimum earning windows  
- “island coverage” incentives to prevent clustering  

This reduces excessive surge volatility.

### 9. Designed pricing events for event sourcing
Every fare calculation emits events:
- PRICE_ESTIMATED  
- SURGE_APPLIED  
- SURGE_ZONE_CHANGED  
- FINAL_FARE_CALCULATED  

These events:
- make debugging easier  
- allow replay of historical pricing  
- help resolve fare disputes  
- allow system audits  

Pricing events become part of Bimride’s immutable history.

### 10. Integrated pricing with routing engine
Trip duration predictions come from routing.

I built a conceptual flow:
- Get estimated route  
- Calculate travel time using historical speed curves  
- Compute base fare  
- Apply surge multiplier  
- Normalize result to minimum fare  

Routing accuracy → pricing accuracy → user trust.

### 11. Designed caching strategy
Price estimates should be fast (< 200 ms).  
I added:
- zone-level cache (30 seconds)  
- precomputed multipliers  
- short-lived fare caches  

This keeps system responsive.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride

### 1. Stronger revenue model
Dynamic pricing ensures that Bimride remains financially sustainable and competitive, especially during tourism peaks.

### 2. Better driver availability
Surge multipliers reward drivers for entering high-demand areas, reducing rider wait times.

### 3. Higher rider trust
Transparent breakdowns help riders understand:
- why prices went up  
- how surge helps reduce wait time  
- whether prices will stabilize soon  

Trust = long-term retention.

### 4. Optimized performance during peak hours
Busy periods (cruise days, airport rushes) require intelligent pricing to maintain equilibrium.

### 5. More accurate ETAs and fare estimates
Better routing + better data → more reliable expectations.

### 6. Future readiness
Dynamic pricing supports:
- corporate rides  
- subscription bundles  
- scheduled rides  
- multi-island scaling  

### 7. Ability to prevent exploitation
Fairness constraints keep Bimride aligned with community values and avoid predatory behavior.

Overall, today’s work produced a robust conceptual pricing engine—dynamic, fair, scalable, and deeply tailored to Barbados’ real-world mobility patterns. This engine will become one of the core pillars powering Bimride’s long-term success.
