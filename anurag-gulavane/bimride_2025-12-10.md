# Daily Progress Report – December 10, 2025

## Overview
Work centered on evaluating routing reliability under inconsistent GPS conditions common in narrow-road and rural regions.

---

## Activities

### 1. Assessed GPS Error Patterns
Reviewed common failure modes including signal drift and delayed updates.

---

### 2. Designed Routing Abstractions
Separated raw GPS ingestion from routing decisions to allow error correction layers.

---

### 3. Considered Fallback Strategies
Explored graceful degradation when high-confidence location data is unavailable.

---

## How This Ties to Bimride
Reliable routing is critical for safety, ETA accuracy, and driver confidence.

---

## Reflection
Real-world constraints often invalidate idealized models; systems must be resilient to imperfection.
