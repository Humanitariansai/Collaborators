# Daily Progress Report – October 29, 2025

## Overview
Today I studied **API versioning and backward compatibility**, understanding how mobility platforms evolve features without breaking older app clients. Bimride will eventually deploy updates frequently, so version stability is crucial.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed Versioning Strategies**
I explored:
- URI versioning (`/v1/…`)  
- Header-based versioning  
- Semantic versioning  
- Deprecation periods  

Clear versioning prevents client breakage.

### **2. Studied Contract Stability Guarantees**
I learned how companies maintain:
- non-breaking changes  
- additive-only modifications  
- deprecation timelines  

This allows safe evolution of Bimride’s APIs.

### **3. Designed Versioning Scenarios**
Examples:
- surge pricing v2 with additional metadata  
- routing engine v3 with new optimization flags  
- payment receipts v2 supporting refunds  

Each requires compatibility planning.

### **4. Drafted Bimride Versioning Rules**
Rules include:
- older clients must keep working  
- log version usage  
- announce deprecations early  
- avoid breaking changes unless absolutely necessary

Backward compatibility ensures all riders/drivers continue functioning.

### **2. Supports Gradual Feature Rollouts**
Versioning allows new pricing/routing logic without disruption.

### **3. Improves Developer Velocity**
Teams ship features faster when older clients are safe.

### **4. Enables Long-Term Platform Stability**
Version rules keep Bimride predictable and trustworthy.
