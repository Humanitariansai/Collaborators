# Daily Progress Report – October 10, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **CI/CD pipelines**, understanding how automated testing, building, and deployment shape the development speed of modern software companies. 
For Bimride, CI/CD will be essential for releasing high-quality updates without downtime.

## Activities
### **1. Studied CI Pipeline Structure**
I reviewed:
- code linting  
- unit tests  
- integration tests  
- security checks  
- build steps  

This clarified how small mistakes are caught early.

### **2. Explored CD Patterns**
I learned about:
- blue-green deployments  
- canary releases  
- rolling updates  

These methods help deploy updates safely.

### **3. Tested Workflow Orchestration Tools**
I explored:
- GitHub Actions  
- GitLab CI  
- Jenkins  

Each offers different scaling capabilities.

### **4. Drafted CI/CD Workflow for Bimride**
Stages include:
- pull request checks  
- automated test suite  
- container builds  
- staged rollouts  

This creates a solid engineering foundation.
