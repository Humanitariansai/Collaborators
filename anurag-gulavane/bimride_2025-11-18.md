# Daily Progress Report – November 18, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **Bimride’s Payments, Wallet, and Settlement Infrastructure** — the financial backbone of the entire platform. If routing is the nervous system and ingestion is the sensor layer, then payments are the heart and circulatory system. A mobility platform lives or dies on how money flows: how quickly riders can pay, how reliably drivers receive earnings, how disputes are resolved, how refunds propagate, and how settlement audits maintain platform integrity.

For Barbados — a tourism-heavy, cash-friendly, partially card-dependent economy — payment design must account for:
- international tourists with foreign cards  
- locals who prefer cash or debit cards  
- drivers who need fast payouts  
- fluctuating processing fees across card networks  
- diverse bank compatibility  
- potential expansion to nearby islands  

Today I built a comprehensive architecture covering everything from payment tokenization to driver payouts to multi-currency support and fraud detection.

## Activities

### 1. Broke down the complete payments lifecycle
A robust mobility payment stack handles:

1. **Rider payment method storage**  
2. **Fare estimation tokenization**  
3. **Trip completion charge workflow**  
4. **Post-trip adjustments**  
5. **Refund pipeline**  
6. **Driver earnings allocation**  
7. **Wallet accounting**  
8. **Daily/weekly settlements**  
9. **Fraud and anomaly detection**  
10. **Financial event sourcing**  

Every step must be reliable, atomic, and auditable.

---

### 2. Designed secure payment method storage
Riders should feel confident that their cards are safe.

I implemented:
- tokenization through PCI-compliant processors  
- 3D Secure escalation for risky transactions  
- multi-device fingerprinting  
- CVV never stored, even encrypted  
- per-device payment authorization  

Tourists often use foreign cards; the system must:
- retry through multiple card networks  
- attempt currency fallbacks  
- gracefully handle bank declines  

Security + smooth UX is critical.

---

### 3. Built the fare-finalization workflow
At trip completion:
1. System calculates final fare  
2. Applies surge/multiplier  
3. Deducts wait-time fees (if appropriate)  
4. Applies promotions or credits  
5. Locks fare in event log  
6. Sends authorization request  
7. Charges rider  

If the rider’s card fails:
- app prompts new card  
- system retries with network-specific rules  
- rider can pay later through wallet  

No fare disappears — everything remains in the ledger.

---

### 4. Created multi-currency support
Barbados uses BBD, but:
- most tourists pay in USD  
- some may use CAD, GBP, EUR  

I built:
- exchange rate sync via reliable FX APIs  
- ability to charge in user’s native currency  
- settlement in BBD for drivers  
- transparent receipt breakdown  
- FX rounding rules  

This reduces tourist confusion and increases conversion.

---

### 5. Designed driver earnings pipeline
Drivers earn money through:
- trip fares  
- surge bonuses  
- incentive payouts  
- refunds (if riders pay cancellation fees)  
- loyalty rewards  

I created:
- driver wallet ledger  
- running balance model  
- atomic earnings transactions  
- incentive stacking logic  
- tip allocation with delayed settlement  

Drivers see:
- trip earnings  
- bonuses  
- adjustments  
- predicted weekly payout  

Transparency builds trust.

---

### 6. Modeled settlement cycles
Bimride must settle payouts:

- daily (fast-pay)  
- weekly (standard)  
- on-demand (future option)  

System checks:
- bank compatibility  
- KYC completion  
- fraud flags  
- minimum payout threshold  

Settlement events:
- SETTLEMENT_INITIATED  
- SETTLEMENT_CONFIRMED  
- SETTLEMENT_FAILED  
- RETRY_TRIGGERED  

If payout fails, driver gets:
- SMS + app alert  
- instructions to update bank details  

This avoids frustration.

---

### 7. Built real-time fraud detection rules
Common fraud scenarios:
- rider using invalid cards  
- repeated payment failures  
- chargeback farming  
- driver collusion  
- artificially inflated trips  
- bizarre routing patterns  
- device-based payment spoofing  

Fraud engine uses:
- location  
- trip duration  
- driver behavior  
- routing anomalies  
- card-network feedback  
- device fingerprint patterns  
- payment failure history  

If flagged:
- trip locked  
- payout paused  
- support alerted  

Protects platform profitability.

---

### 8. Implemented dispute & chargeback workflow
When banks reverse charges:
1. System receives chargeback event  
2. Trip + logs reconstructed  
3. Evidence package built:
   - map playback  
   - chat transcript  
   - timestamps  
   - pricing breakdown  
   - driver behavior logs  
4. Submitted automatically to processor  

Drivers aren’t penalized unless fraud is proven.

---

### 9. Added rider credits & promo infrastructure
Promotions must be:
- flexible  
- stackable  
- time-limited  
- zone-based  
- incentive-integrated  

Examples:
- “$5 off airport rides this weekend”  
- “Welcome credit for new users”  
- “Low-demand hour discount”  

Credits are stored in:
- wallet ledger  
- promotion table  

Automatically applied at checkout.

---

### 10. Built financial event sourcing
Every money-related action emits an event:
- PAYMENT_METHOD_ADDED  
- AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS  
- PAYMENT_FAILED  
- FARE_FINALIZED  
- TIP_ADDED  
- EARNINGS_CREDITED  
- SETTLEMENT_SENT  
- REFUND_INITIATED  

This allows:
- audits  
- reconciliation  
- forecasting  
- dispute support  
- financial health metrics  

Bimride becomes financially transparent internally.

---

### 11. Designed low-connectivity payment fallback
Tourists often lose data at beaches or rural areas.

Fallback:
- pre-authorize estimated fare  
- store encrypted offline token  
- finalize when device reconnects  

Ensures reliability in fluctuating signal zones.

---

### 12. Integrated payments with pricing fairness
If pricing engine detects:
- lower-than-expected traffic  
- route correction  
- speed anomalies  

it may:
- reduce fare  
- waive wait-time fees  
- refund portion automatically  

Payments + routing + safety all synchronize.

## Extended Reflection (Daily Only)

Designing the payments system made me appreciate something fundamental: **mobility is a financial service wrapped inside transportation.** Riders are paying for time, movement, and reliability. Drivers rely on earnings as part of their livelihood. Any failure in payment flow immediately damages trust.

Three insights emerged:

### **1. Payments define professionalism.**  
If payouts fail, drivers leave.  
If charges fail, riders distrust the app.  
Payments must feel invisible — meaning they must be perfect.

### **2. Barbados adds complexity.**  
Tourists + locals + foreign cards + mixed connectivity =  
a system that must handle volatility with grace.

### **3. Payments connect every subsystem.**  
Pricing → routing → safety → incentives → support → payouts → fraud detection.  
They all converge at the ledger.

Today’s system design ensures Bimride will feel financially stable, transparent, and trustworthy — the backbone of a world-class mobility platform.
