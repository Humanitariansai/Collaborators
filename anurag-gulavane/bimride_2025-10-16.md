# Daily Progress Report – October 16, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **Kubernetes orchestration**, understanding how containerized services are managed, scaled, and monitored in production. 
Even though Bimride may start small, orchestration becomes essential as more backend components come online.

## Activities
### **1. Studied Kubernetes Core Concepts**
I learned:
- pods  
- deployments  
- services  
- ConfigMaps  
- autoscaling  

These components orchestrate containers automatically.

### **2. Explored Autoscaling Strategies**
I reviewed:
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)  
- Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)  
- cluster autoscaling  

Mobility apps often require aggressive autoscaling during peak events.

### **3. Practiced Writing Deployment YAML**
I drafted:
- deployment files  
- service files  
- resource limits  

This helped me visualize how Bimride’s services could be deployed cleanly.

### **4. Designed a Kubernetes Architecture for Bimride**
A possible layout:
- routing engine scaled aggressively  
- pricing engine with moderate scaling  
- trip manager with high consistency guarantees  
- notification service with event-driven scaling  

This created a realistic orchestration plan.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. On-Demand Scalability**
Kubernetes ensures Bimride handles traffic spikes smoothly.

### **2. Stable Rollouts**
Controlled deployments reduce risk during updates.

### **3. Efficient Resource Usage**
Autoscaling ensures cost-effective infrastructure.

### **4. Foundation for Multi-Island Clusters**
Kubernetes simplifies deploying Bimride across different regions.
