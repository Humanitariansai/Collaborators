# Daily Progress Report – December 11, 2025

## Overview
Focused on balancing real-time computation with backend cost efficiency in dispatch and pricing workflows.

---

## Activities

### 1. Identified High-Cost Computations
Flagged areas where repeated calculations could be cached or approximated.

---

### 2. Evaluated Tradeoffs
Balanced freshness of data against computational overhead.

---

### 3. Defined Cost-Aware Design Principles
Documented guidelines for deciding when precision is worth the cost.

---

## How This Ties to Bimride
Cost-efficient computation enables sustainable scaling without degrading service quality.

---

## Reflection
Scalability is as much an economic problem as it is a technical one.
