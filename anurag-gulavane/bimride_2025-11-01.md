# Daily Progress Report – November 1, 2025

## Overview
Today I explored **map matching algorithms**, which adjust raw GPS points to the real road network. GPS inaccuracies occur frequently on islands with narrow roads or signal bounce—so robust map matching is vital for Bimride’s ETA accuracy and trip reliability.

## Activities
### **1. Studied GPS Noise Patterns**
I reviewed how GPS noise comes from:
- reflective surfaces  
- weak satellite visibility  
- narrow streets  
- sudden turns  

This highlighted common inaccuracies Bimride will face.

### **2. Explored Map-Matching Techniques**
I studied:
- Hidden Markov Models  
- geometric snapping  
- probabilistic path inference  

These help determine the most likely road a driver is on.

### **3. Tested Path Reconstruction Logic**
I simulated:
- snapping points to nearest edges  
- inferring direction  
- smoothing noisy tracks  

This made map matching feel intuitive.

### **4. Designed Bimride Map-Matching Flow**
Key steps:
- receive GPS point  
- filter noise  
- snap to road graph  
- infer movement direction  
- update driver location state

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Better ETA Accuracy**
Cleaned GPS helps routing engine calculate travel time accurately.

### **2. Smoother Trip Playback**
Trip histories look cleaner when mapped correctly.

### **3. Lower Rider Complaints**
Fewer cases of “my driver is on the wrong road.”

### **4. Realistic and Reliable Driver Tracking**
Map matching helps Bimride deliver professional-grade tracking.
