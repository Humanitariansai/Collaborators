# Daily Progress Report – October 24, 2025

## Overview
Today I studied **push notification infrastructure**, exploring how ride confirmations, driver arrival updates, payment receipts, and trip reminders are reliably delivered to riders and drivers.

## Activities
### **1. Reviewed Notification Providers**
I studied:
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)  
- Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)  
- vendor aggregator services  

These form the backbone of mobile communication.

### **2. Explored Delivery Guarantees**
I analyzed:
- retry strategies  
- device offline handling  
- collapse keys (dropping old notifications)  
- priority levels  

Critical updates—like “Driver Arriving”—must always be delivered.

### **3. Designed Notification Payloads**
I experimented with:
- lightweight JSON payloads  
- rich notifications  
- action-based notifications (Accept/Decline)  

Optimized payloads lower latency.

### **4. Mapped Bimride Notification Types**
Examples include:
- ride request accepted  
- driver arrival  
- payment receipt  
- surge zone alerts  
- lost item reminders  

This created a full notification architecture.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Enhances Real-Time Experience**
Notifications keep riders informed and reduce anxiety.

### **2. Improves Driver Efficiency**
Timely alerts help drivers respond faster.

### **3. Reduces App Polling**
Notifications lower backend load by reducing repeated checks.

### **4. Supports Tourism Market Needs**
Visitors rely heavily on clear updates for safety and comfort.
