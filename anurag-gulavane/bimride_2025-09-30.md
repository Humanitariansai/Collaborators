# Daily Progress Report – September 30, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on **API authentication methods**, especially token-based systems like JWT and session-based auth. Mobility apps require secure but lightweight authentication to protect rider and driver accounts.

## Activities
### **1. Studied JWT Structure**
I reviewed:
- header  
- payload  
- signature  
and how verification works using secret keys.  
This helped me see how Bimride could issue tokens quickly on login.

### **2. Compared Session vs Token Auth**
Sessions require server storage.  
Tokens are stateless.  
For a mobile-first app, token-based auth is more scalable.

### **3. Explored Refresh Tokens and Expiration**
I studied how apps maintain long-lived sessions securely by rotating refresh tokens.  
This prevents hijacking and protects user accounts.

### **4. Designed Authentication Flow for Bimride**
Possible sequence:
- login → access token + refresh token  
- expired token → refresh  
- suspicious activity → revoke token  
This creates a balanced, secure experience.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride
### **1. Keeps Rider and Driver Accounts Secure**
Strong token verification prevents impersonation or fraudulent logins.

### **2. Reduces Backend Load**
Stateless tokens reduce database queries for session verification.

### **3. Enables Multi-Device Login for Drivers**
Drivers often switch phones — tokens make this transition smooth.

### **4. Supports Future Expansion**
Secure auth is foundational for scaling Bimride to other islands or service lines.
