# Daily Progress Report – September 23, 2025

## Overview
Today I focused on understanding **HTTP caching mechanisms** and how different caching layers—browser caches, CDN caches, reverse proxies, and application-level caches—directly influence the performance and cost-efficiency of mobility apps. My aim was not to memorize theory, but to understand how caching can make Bimride feel instantly faster and more reliable for riders and drivers in Barbados.

## Activities

### **1. Learned How Browser Caching Works**
I studied how browsers use caching headers like `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, and `Last-Modified` to avoid unnecessary network requests.  
For a mobile-first platform like Bimride, reducing repeated asset loads dramatically improves perceived speed.

### **2. Explored CDN-Level Caching**
I examined how CDNs store static assets and sometimes even API responses.  
This matters for Barbados because CDN nodes close to the region reduce latency for both riders and drivers.

### **3. Studied Reverse Proxy Caching**
Reverse proxies like Nginx or Varnish can cache frequently requested API responses (e.g., ETA lookups).  
Mobility platforms often receive repeated queries for similar routes or areas—caching can instantly improve responsiveness.

### **4. Designed a Caching Architecture for Bimride**
A possible caching strategy:
- Static assets → CDN  
- ETA lookups → 10–15 sec proxy cache  
- Pricing estimates → short TTL cache  
- Routing responses → in-memory (Redis)  
- Trip history → device-side caching  
This layered approach makes the system faster without increasing backend load.

## How Today’s Work Ties to Bimride

### **1. Faster User Experience**
Caching ensures Bimride’s UI loads instantly even on slow connections.

### **2. Lower Server Load and Cost**
Tourism seasons can produce massive bursts of usage—caching absorbs much of that load.

### **3. Improved Reliability**
Even if core services slow down, cached responses prevent total failure for riders requesting ETAs or prices.

### **4. Stronger Long-Term Architecture**
Understanding caching ensures Bimride’s backend remains lean, efficient, and scalable over time.
