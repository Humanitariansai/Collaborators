# Bimride OPT Daily Work Log
**Week:** Dec 29, 2025 – Jan 2, 2026  
**Day:** Tuesday

## 1. Summary of Progress This Week
On Tuesday, my work contributed directly to the weekly objective of onboarding into Bimride’s
technical environment and developing a working understanding of the backend system architecture.
The focus remained on building a reliable mental model of how the application components interact,
including API endpoints, service layers, and database persistence. I spent the day methodically
analyzing existing backend workflows, ensuring that I understood how requests were processed
end-to-end and how data moved through the system.

Progress on this day was incremental but essential. Rather than implementing large features,
I concentrated on foundational understanding that would enable safe and correct future development.
This included reviewing existing backend services, examining configuration files, and identifying
how environment variables, dependencies, and deployment assumptions were structured. These efforts
directly supported the broader weekly progress of becoming productive within the codebase.

## 2. Any Challenges or Blockers?
The primary challenges encountered on Tuesday involved navigating a legacy codebase with limited
centralized documentation. Several modules relied on implicit assumptions that were not immediately
obvious, requiring careful reading of function implementations and call chains. This slowed initial
progress, as additional time was needed to verify understanding before proceeding.

Another challenge was ensuring that local development accurately reflected production-like behavior.
Minor discrepancies in configuration required troubleshooting to confirm that observed behavior
matched expected system behavior. While these issues did not fully block progress, they required
deliberate investigation to avoid misinterpretation of system functionality.

## 3. List of Tasks Completed
- Reviewed backend service structure and directory organization
- Traced API request lifecycles from entry point to database interaction
- Analyzed data models and relationships within the database schema
- Verified local development environment setup and dependency installation
- Documented observations and assumptions for future reference

## 4. Ongoing Tasks
- Continue deepening understanding of backend business logic
- Identify potential areas for refactoring or optimization
- Expand internal notes into clearer technical documentation
- Prepare to begin implementing small, low-risk backend changes

The work completed on Tuesday established a stable technical foundation for subsequent development
activities. By prioritizing correctness and understanding, I ensured that future contributions
could be made efficiently and with minimal risk to system stability.
