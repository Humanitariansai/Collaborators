     - Start date with Humanitarians AI
     - Expected end date or duration of commitment

## Documentation Requirements

### Bi-Weekly Updates (MANDATORY)

All fellows MUST provide updates at minimum every two weeks. This is non-negotiable and essential for maintaining active status in the program.

Your bi-weekly updates should:

1. Be committed directly to your personal folder in the project's Fellows directory
2. Use the following naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_update.md`
3. Include:
   - Summary of work completed in the past two weeks
   - Challenges encountered and how they were addressed
   - Goals for the next two weeks
   - Any resources or assistance needed
   - Hours contributed during this period

### Project Documentation

Beyond your personal updates, fellows should contribute to the project's main documentation as appropriate:

- Code comments
- Function/module documentation
- User guides
- Technical specifications
- Research findings

## Directory Structure Example

```
Humanitarians_AI/
├── Project_A/                      # Collaborator's project folder
│   ├── README.md                   # Project description
│   ├── [Project files]             # Code, data, etc.
│   └── Fellows/                    # Fellows directory
│       ├── Jane_Smith/             # Individual fellow folder

│   ├── README.md
│   ├── [Project files]
│   └── Fellows/
│       └── ...
```

## Tracking and Evaluation

The GitHub-based tracking system provides an objective basis for evaluating contributions. The following metrics will be considered when assessing work:

- Frequency and quality of commits
- Consistency of bi-weekly updates
- Contributions to project milestones
- Collaboration with other team members
- Quality and impact of work produced

### Collaborator Responsibilities

As a collaborator, you are expected to:
- Maintain your project's documentation and codebase
- Review and provide feedback on your fellows' bi-weekly updates
- Ensure your fellows are following the documentation guidelines
- Report any issues with fellows' participation to the HR team
- Participate in regular collaborator meetings

## Recommendation Letters and Verifications

### Recommendation Letters
Recommendation letters will only be issued to fellows who:
1. Have been active contributors for a minimum duration (typically 2-3 months)
2. Have maintained regular bi-weekly updates throughout their involvement
3. Have made substantial, verifiable contributions to their project
4. Have properly documented their work following the guidelines above

### Visa and Employment Verification

**IMPORTANT:** The same documentation requirements apply to any visa or employment verification requests:

- Active participation must be continuously documented through GitHub
- If fellows stop making bi-weekly updates, we will assume they left the program on the date of their last update
- Even if fellows continue working but fail to document it, we cannot verify participation beyond the last documented update
- Employment and visa verification letters will only reflect the dates and contributions that are properly documented in GitHub
- It is each fellow's responsibility to maintain an accurate record of their involvement through regular commits and updates

This policy exists to ensure integrity and accuracy in our official verifications. Humanitarians AI can only verify what is objectively documented in our systems.

## Entrepreneurship Program

### Requirements for Commercial Use of Project Work

If you plan to use code or other intellectual property developed during your volunteer work with Humanitarians AI for commercial purposes or to start a business, you **MUST**:

1. Apply to be part of the official Humanitarians AI Entrepreneurship Program
2. Acknowledge that Humanitarians AI will receive a 5% ownership stake in any resulting venture
3. Formalize this relationship through proper legal agreements

This requirement reflects the extensive support, mentorship, resources, and infrastructure that Humanitarians AI provides to its volunteers and projects. The organization actively encourages entrepreneurial initiatives while ensuring fair recognition of its contributions to your success.

### Intellectual Property Reminder

All volunteers should remember that they have signed agreements containing the following language:

Unless so requested or otherwise permitted in writing by Humanitarians AI, Volunteer will not apply for any patents or copyrights, whether domestic or foreign, on all or any portion of the Developments.*
> 
> *By execution of this Agreement, Volunteer irrevocably constitutes and appoints Humanitarians AI and its executive officers, with full power of substitution, to be its true and lawful attorney, in its name, place and stead, to execute, acknowledge, swear to and file all instruments, conveyances, certificates, agreements and other documents, and to take any action which will be necessary, appropriate or desirable to effectuate the foregoing provisions regarding assigning, securing, protecting or registering property rights in the Developments. The powers of attorney granted herein will be deemed to be coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable and survive the occurrence of the death or incapacity of Volunteer.*

## Community Engagement and Social Media

### Supporting the Humanitarians AI Community

Active engagement with the Humanitarians AI community is highly valued and considered when evaluating commitment to our mission. All participants are strongly encouraged to follow and engage with our official social media channels:

- **LinkedIn**: [Humanitarians AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/105696953/)
- **SoundCloud**: [Humanitarians AI](https://soundcloud.com/humanitarians-ai)
- **Spotify**: [Humanitarians AI](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3cj3R4pDpYQHaWx0MM2vFV)
- **Apple Music**: [Humanitarians AI](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/humanitarians-ai/1781414009)

  **Please Star the Github repo that your project is in**

### Engagement Expectations

When evaluating extension requests and overall commitment to the program, we consider:

1. **Regular Engagement**: Following our social channels and engaging with posts
2. **Content Sharing**: Resharing Humanitarians AI content with your professional network
3. **Thoughtful Interaction**: Commenting on and supporting other participants' achievements
4. **Community Ambassadorship**: Representing our mission in your professional communications

### Why Community Engagement Matters

Your engagement with our content and community demonstrates:
- Commitment to our shared mission beyond individual project work
- Support for the broader Humanitarians AI ecosystem
- Willingness to help expand our impact and reach
- Investment in the community's collective success

**Important Note**: While social media engagement is considered as a positive factor when evaluating extension requests and overall commitment, it complements but does not replace the mandatory GitHub documentation requirements outlined in this document. Proper documentation of your work remains the primary requirement for program participation and verification.

By following these guidelines, you'll not only create a valuable record of your contributions but also develop professional skills in documentation, collaboration, and project management that will benefit your future career.

*Humanitarians AI - Using AI for Good*
</artifact>

I've updated the document to focus on the structure and requirements for both collaborators and fellows. The key changes include:

1. **Added a dedicated "For Collaborators" section** that outlines:
   - How to create a project subfolder/directory
   - What should be included in the project description
   - Responsibilities for managing fellows within their project

2. **Created a clearer directory structure** showing:
   - How collaborators should organize their project folders
   - Where fellows should create their personal directories
   - How bi-weekly updates should be stored and named

3. **Included a visual directory structure example** to make the hierarchy clear

4. **Added collaborator-specific responsibilities** to help them understand their role in:
   - Maintaining project documentation
   - Ensuring fellows follow the reporting guidelines
   - Managing their project team effectively

The document maintains all the critical requirements from the original, including bi-weekly updates, documentation standards, and verification policies, while adding the specific subfolder/directory structure you requested.
