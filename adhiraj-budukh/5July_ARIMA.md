## Time Series Forecasting Using ARIMA and Prophet for Ride Demand Prediction

---

## 1. Introduction

Accurately predicting future ride demand is essential for ensuring optimal driver allocation, minimizing wait times, and maximizing user satisfaction. In this article, we explore two powerful time series forecasting algorithms: **ARIMA** and **Facebook Prophet**, and their role in demand prediction for BimRide.

## 2. Problem Statement

BimRide must forecast future ride demand based on historical data to:

- Predict surge areas in advance
- Pre-allocate drivers in high-demand zones
- Improve pricing strategy dynamically

We need an approach that handles:
- Seasonality (e.g., rush hours, weekends)
- Trends (e.g., growing user base)
- Holiday effects and anomalies

## 3. Algorithm Overview

### 3.1 ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

ARIMA is a traditional statistical model used for time series analysis and forecasting. It is composed of:
- **AR (p)**: Autoregression
- **I (d)**: Differencing to make the series stationary
- **MA (q)**: Moving Average

Best suited for stationary time series with linear trends.

### 3.2 Prophet by Facebook

Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool by Meta that:
- Handles missing data and outliers
- Supports daily, weekly, yearly seasonality
- Allows inclusion of custom holidays/events

Prophet is ideal for business time series with strong seasonal effects.

## 4. Challenges Faced

### 4.1 Stationarity Check (for ARIMA)
- **Problem**: ARIMA assumes stationary series.
- **Solution**: Use Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and differencing.

### 4.2 Holiday & Event Impact
- **Problem**: Sudden spikes due to concerts, festivals, etc.
- **Solution**: Prophet allows custom holiday calendars to be included.

### 4.3 Overfitting
- **Problem**: Both models can overfit if hyperparameters are not tuned properly.
- **Solution**: Use cross-validation to test model generalization.

## 5. Implementation

### 5.1 Sample Code Using Prophet

```python
from prophet import Prophet
import pandas as pd

# Load time series ride data
df = pd.read_csv('bimride_demand.csv')
df.columns = ['ds', 'y']  # Prophet requires these column names

# Create and fit the model
model = Prophet()
model.add_country_holidays(country_name='US')
model.fit(df)

# Forecast future demand
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=48, freq='H')  # 48 hours ahead
forecast = model.predict(future)

# Plot
model.plot(forecast)
```
