# Studying of Different Algorithm for Implementing on BimRide

## 1. Introduction

In this foundational article for a 100-part series, we explore a critical algorithm used in both computer science and data analytics: **K-Means Clustering**. This algorithm provides insight into unsupervised learning and plays a significant role in ride-hailing applications like BimRide by aiding in demand prediction, surge pricing zones, and fleet management.

## 2. Problem Definition

How can BimRide dynamically identify **hot zones** for high passenger demand in real-time, and deploy drivers accordingly, without manual analysis?

The core data analysis problem is spatial-temporal **clustering** of ride request data. The goal is to group similar geolocations of requests (latitude, longitude) to:
- Pre-allocate drivers before demand peaks.
- Automate surge pricing logic.
- Reduce passenger wait times.

## 3. Algorithm Overview: K-Means Clustering

K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups a dataset into `k` number of distinct clusters based on feature similarity. For our use case, the features can be:
- GPS coordinates (lat, lon)
- Request timestamps
- Pickup counts in a time interval

### 3.1 How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Choose `k` initial centroids randomly.
2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. **Update**: Recalculate centroids as the mean of assigned data points.
4. **Repeat**: Until convergence (no change in centroids).

## 4. Challenges Faced

### 4.1 Determining the Right Number of Clusters (`k`)
- **Problem**: Choosing too few clusters leads to generalization; too many causes overfitting.
- **Solution**: We used the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal `k` where the intra-cluster variance drops significantly.

### 4.2 Geospatial Distance Calculations
- **Problem**: K-Means uses Euclidean distance which doesn't suit spherical coordinates (lat/lon).
- **Solution**: Project GPS coordinates using Haversine or convert to a local Cartesian plane.

### 4.3 Skewed Data Distribution
- **Problem**: Dense urban areas like downtown receive high ride volume, while others are sparse.
- **Solution**: Normalize data or use **Mini-Batch K-Means** for better performance on large datasets.

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Dataset Used
We used a simulated dataset of 100,000 BimRide requests with:
- Pickup latitude & longitude
- Timestamps
- Ride counts per zone per hour

### 5.2 Sample Code (Python)

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load ride request data
data = pd.read_csv('bimride_requests.csv')
coords = data[['latitude', 'longitude']]

# Apply K-Means
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=6, init='k-means++', random_state=42)
data['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(coords)

# Plot clusters
plt.scatter(data['longitude'], data['latitude'], c=data['cluster'], cmap='viridis')
plt.title('BimRide Demand Clusters')
plt.xlabel('Longitude')
plt.ylabel('Latitude')
plt.show()
```
