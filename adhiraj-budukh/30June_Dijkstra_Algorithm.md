# Studying of Different Algorithm for Implementing on BimRide

## Abstract

This article is the first in a series exploring essential computer science algorithms and their practical applications within **BimRide**, a ride-hailing application. We begin with a foundational pathfinding algorithm — **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** — analyzing its working principles, challenges encountered during implementation, and its significance for real-time mobility services.

## 1. Introduction

Ride-hailing platforms like BimRide depend heavily on efficient routing, optimal driver-passenger matching, and real-time decision-making. At the core of many of these features lie classical computer science algorithms. In this study, we analyze Dijkstra’s Algorithm — a shortest-path algorithm — and investigate how it can be adapted and optimized for use in BimRide.

## 2. Algorithm Overview: Dijkstra’s Algorithm

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** is used to find the shortest path between a source node and all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

### 2.1 How It Works

1. Initialize distances from the source to all vertices as infinity, and to the source itself as 0.
2. Set the source node as current and mark all others as unvisited.
3. For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate tentative distances.
4. Update the shortest paths if a smaller path is found.
5. Mark the current node as visited.
6. Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new current node.
7. Repeat until all nodes are visited or destination is reached.

### 2.2 Time Complexity

- Using a simple array: **O(V²)**
- Using a binary heap and adjacency list: **O((V + E) log V)**

Where **V** is the number of vertices and **E** is the number of edges.

## 3. Challenges Encountered

### 3.1 Real-Time Traffic Integration

- **Problem**: Dijkstra’s Algorithm assumes static weights. In real-world road networks, edge weights (representing travel times or distances) vary due to traffic conditions.
- **Solution**: Modify the graph weights dynamically using real-time traffic APIs or predictive models (e.g., linear regression on historical traffic data).

### 3.2 Scalability

- **Problem**: Large cities have graphs with millions of nodes and edges.
- **Solution**: Use **Contraction Hierarchies** or **A\*** with heuristic optimizations to improve performance over large-scale graphs.

### 3.3 Dynamic Re-routing

- **Problem**: A route may become suboptimal due to sudden road closures or accidents.
- **Solution**: Implement **incremental Dijkstra** or **D* Lite** for efficient re-planning without recalculating the entire graph.

## 4. Application in BimRide

### 4.1 Use Case: Optimal Route Calculation

- When a user requests a ride, Dijkstra's algorithm determines the shortest route from the driver’s current location to the user and from the pickup point to the destination.

### 4.2 Use Case: Driver Assignment

- BimRide can use the algorithm to calculate shortest time (not just distance) from multiple drivers to the passenger and assign the nearest one.

### 4.3 Use Case: Cost Estimation

- Ride fare estimation depends on distance and time. Using Dijkstra's algorithm, we can accurately predict trip costs based on the shortest or fastest path.

### 4.4 Use Case: Network Optimization

- Real-time routing for multiple rides simultaneously requires understanding traffic loads, which can be analyzed through repeated use of Dijkstra’s algorithm over changing weight graphs.

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Data Structures Used

- **Graph Representation**: Adjacency List
- **Priority Queue**: Min-Heap (Python: `heapq`, C++: `std::priority_queue` with custom comparator)

### 5.2 Python Pseudocode Snippet

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]

    while pq:
        current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if current_distance > distances[current_vertex]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_vertex]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

## 6. Conclusion

Dijkstra’s algorithm, while classical, remains a crucial part of building intelligent routing systems for ride-hailing applications like BimRide. With appropriate modifications for dynamic environments and large-scale data, it serves as a backbone for real-time navigation, fare estimation, and efficient dispatch systems.
