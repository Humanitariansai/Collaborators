# Report: Customer Acquisition & Retention Dashboards + Workflow Automation for Scaling Operations  
**Date:** 6‚Äì12 September  
**Topics:**  
1. Tableau Dashboards on Customer Acquisition & Retention Strategies (B2C Growth Playbook)  
2. Scaling Operations with Workflow Automation (Case: Dispatch & Customer Support)  

---

## üìå Overview
This week I worked on two interconnected dummy projects:  
1. Designing **Tableau dashboards** to track and improve **customer acquisition & retention**.  
2. Implementing a **workflow automation prototype** for **ride dispatch & customer support** operations.  

Both initiatives simulate how **Bimride** can scale strategically while keeping **customer satisfaction and operational efficiency** at the core.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dummy Project Work (Step by Step)

### Part 1: Tableau Dashboards ‚Äì Customer Acquisition & Retention (B2C Growth Playbook)

#### Step 1: Data Preparation
- Collected **dummy datasets**:
  - Rider sign-ups per month.  
  - Active riders vs churned riders.  
  - Ride frequency per user.  
  - CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) per marketing channel (ads, referrals, promotions).  
  - LTV (Lifetime Value) per rider cohort.  

- Cleaned data using Excel ‚Üí imported into **Tableau**.  

---

#### Step 2: Building KPIs
Defined key KPIs to monitor:  
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** = Total Marketing Spend √∑ New Riders.  
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)** = Avg Ride Value √ó Ride Frequency √ó Retention Months √ó Commission %.  
- **Retention Rate** = (Active Users at End of Period √∑ Active Users at Start) √ó 100.  
- **Churn Rate** = 100 ‚Äì Retention Rate.  
- **Cohort Analysis** = Rider retention by signup month.  

---

#### Step 3: Creating Dashboards
Designed **3 dashboards in Tableau**:  

1. **Acquisition Dashboard**  
   - CAC by channel (ads, referral, partnerships).  
   - Conversion funnel (App downloads ‚Üí Account creation ‚Üí First ride).  

2. **Retention Dashboard**  
   - Rider cohort analysis (e.g., % of riders retained after 1, 3, 6 months).  
   - Average rides per rider over time.  

3. **Revenue Impact Dashboard**  
   - LTV vs CAC ratio.  
   - Break-even analysis by customer segment.  

---

#### Step 4: Insights (Dummy Example Results)
- Facebook Ads CAC = $12, Referral CAC = $5 ‚Üí referrals most cost-efficient.  
- Cohort analysis showed **40% of riders stop after first month** ‚Üí onboarding improvements needed.  
- LTV:CAC ratio = 4:1 (healthy, but can be improved with better retention).  

---

### Part 2: Workflow Automation ‚Äì Dispatch & Customer Support

#### Step 1: Mapping Existing Workflow
Mapped out Bimride‚Äôs current operations:  
- Ride request ‚Üí Driver match ‚Üí Driver confirmation ‚Üí Ride completion.  
- Support requests ‚Üí Manual ticket handling ‚Üí Resolution.  

---

#### Step 2: Identifying Pain Points
- Dispatch delays when multiple requests hit peak hours.  
- Drivers rejecting trips, causing delays.  
- Customer complaints not always resolved quickly (manual follow-ups).  

---

#### Step 3: Dummy Automation Prototype
Using **n8n (workflow automation tool)**, I simulated:  
- **Automated Dispatch Rules:**  
  - Assign ride request to nearest driver within 5 seconds.  
  - Auto-reassign if driver doesn‚Äôt respond in 15 seconds.  

- **Customer Support Automation:**  
  - New complaint ‚Üí auto-log in CRM ‚Üí auto-assign to available agent.  
  - FAQ-type complaints auto-responded via chatbot integration.  

---

#### Step 4: Test Scenarios
- Simulated **100 dummy ride requests** ‚Üí automated dispatch reduced avg assignment time from **30s ‚Üí 8s**.  
- Simulated **50 dummy customer complaints** ‚Üí chatbot resolved 40% instantly.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced
1. **Tableau Data Limitations** ‚Äì Dummy datasets lacked complexity (no real-world noise like failed payments, multi-device logins).  
2. **Customer Retention Complexity** ‚Äì Hard to simulate behavioral triggers (seasonal effects, price sensitivity).  
3. **Automation Pitfalls** ‚Äì Automated dispatch sometimes created **overlapping requests** (two drivers assigned to same rider).  
4. **Customer Support AI Limitations** ‚Äì Chatbot couldn‚Äôt handle nuanced complaints (e.g., disputes about ride fare).  
5. **Scalability Concerns** ‚Äì Simulated automations worked well on dummy data but may strain real systems under 10k+ concurrent users.

## üöñ Application in Bimride (Ride-Hailing)

### Tableau Dashboards
- **Investor Relations:** Dashboards provide **visual evidence** of customer growth & retention strategy.  
- **Management:** Helps monitor CAC & retention in real time.  
- **Strategy:** Insights allow targeted marketing (e.g., expand referral programs).  

### Workflow Automation
- **Faster Dispatch:** Improves rider satisfaction ‚Üí higher retention.  
- **Efficient Support:** Reduced response time ‚Üí stronger trust in Bimride brand.  
- **Cost Savings:** Less manual intervention in support & dispatch.  

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This week‚Äôs dummy projects provided a **dual perspective**:  
- **Strategic (Tableau Dashboards):** Show how Bimride can track and optimize **B2C growth metrics** (acquisition, retention, LTV).  
- **Operational (Workflow Automation):** Demonstrate how **scaling processes** like dispatch & support can be automated for efficiency.  

Together, these two initiatives directly support **Bimride‚Äôs long-term growth strategy** ‚Äì both from an **investor storytelling perspective** and a **day-to-day operational execution perspective**.
