## üìå Overview
This week focused on **applying insights from prior research into real-world simulations and model refinement**.  
Work centered on three parallel goals ‚Äî **improving driver retention**, **predicting support request surges**, and **testing fair pricing models** for riders and drivers.  
All tasks aimed to strengthen **BimRide‚Äôs operational reliability, fairness, and data-driven decision making**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 1: Driver Retention Data Analysis

### Overview
Began analyzing patterns in driver activity to understand what causes drop-offs in engagement.  

### Work Done
1. Collected and cleaned historical driver activity logs.  
2. Grouped users by session length, trip count, and recent inactivity.  
3. Identified trends showing incentive timing strongly affects reactivation rates.  

### Challenges
- Needed clearer labeling for drivers inactive due to technical vs. personal reasons.  

### Application
Findings will guide design of **targeted incentive campaigns** to increase driver re-engagement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 2: Retention Simulation & Incentive Testing

### Overview
Built the first dummy simulation to test behavioral incentives.  

### Work Done
1. Designed dummy incentive triggers (quest, streak, referral).  
2. Measured simulated retention uplift with and without incentives.  
3. Logged engagement rates over multiple time intervals.  

### Challenges
- Simulation currently limited to small sample dataset.  

### Application
The model will later integrate with **real driver performance dashboards**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 3: Support Forecasting Model Refinement

### Overview
Enhanced the support forecasting model with new event-based triggers.  

### Work Done
1. Integrated live event data (trip cancellations, delayed starts).  
2. Improved accuracy of the short-term prediction window (0‚Äì7 days).  
3. Validated model behavior under simulated surge conditions.  

### Challenges
- Occasional over-fitting on low-volume days.  

### Application
Predictive alerts will help **allocate support agents proactively** before ticket spikes occur.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 4: Real-Time Data Validation

### Overview
Ensured that support and retention models handle streaming event data correctly.  

### Work Done
1. Connected test API to fetch live trip and chat events.  
2. Verified latency within acceptable thresholds.  
3. Logged data mismatches for cleanup.  

### Challenges
- Some inconsistent timestamps in dummy events.  

### Application
Improves **real-time decision readiness** across operational models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 5: Pricing Fairness Prototype Initiation

### Overview
Began testing the early concept for **fair pricing between riders and drivers**.  

### Work Done
1. Modeled surge pricing simulation with adjustable fairness ratio.  
2. Compared revenue outcomes under different rider demand levels.  
3. Collected dummy satisfaction data for riders and drivers.  

### Challenges
- Need to calibrate balance between affordability and earnings.  

### Application
Supports **transparent and ethical pricing** that encourages trust and loyalty.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 6: Cross-Model Integration & Documentation

### Overview
Linked retention, support, and pricing experiments into one operational framework.  

### Work Done
1. Created unified documentation showing dependencies.  
2. Outlined flow between user behavior, support load, and pricing logic.  
3. Drafted architecture diagram for the integrated model pipeline.  

### Challenges
- Requires harmonizing data schemas across three test modules.  

### Application
Forms a base for **BimRide‚Äôs predictive operations engine**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 7: Review & Next Steps

### Overview
Reviewed week‚Äôs results and outlined areas needing further testing.  

### Work Done
1. Evaluated retention uplift metrics.  
2. Assessed forecast accuracy improvements.  
3. Planned next sprint for scaling simulation datasets.  

### Challenges
- Limited sample size still restricts generalization.  

### Application
Informs upcoming improvements to **scalability and validation pipelines**.

## ‚úÖ Weekly Summary (Oct 4 ‚Äì Oct 10)

### Current Task Status
Active ‚Äî currently refining the driver retention analysis using behavioral triggers and testing engagement incentives in simulation. Forecasting models for support requests are being validated with new event data. Early work has started on designing the fair pricing prototype for dynamic fare adjustments.

### Summary of Progress This Week/Month
This week focused on turning last week‚Äôs research findings into practical experiments. Driver activity data was analyzed to test how incentive timing affects retention. The support forecasting model was improved with real-time event inputs to enhance accuracy. Work began on the pricing fairness model by simulating rider‚Äìdriver balance under different surge conditions. Documentation has been created to link all three projects under one operational improvement framework for BimRide.

### List of Tasks Completed
- Conducted data analysis on driver inactivity and engagement behavior.  
- Implemented early-stage retention simulation using incentive triggers.  
- Integrated real-time events into the support forecasting model to improve prediction accuracy.  
- Began testing a prototype for dynamic pricing fairness based on rider‚Äìdriver balance.  
- Created initial documentation connecting engagement, support, and pricing models under one operational framework.
