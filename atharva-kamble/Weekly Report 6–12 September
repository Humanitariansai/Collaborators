## üõ†Ô∏è Day 1: Database Reliability & Rollback Testing

### Overview
Explored strategies for **safe migrations** and **rollback verification** under 24/7 uptime requirements.  

### Dummy Project Work
1. Designed expand/contract workflow for a new **`user_profiles`** table.  
2. Built dummy rollback simulation using **feature flags**.  
3. Tested backfill strategies in **batches of 5,000 rows**.  
4. Verified rollback triggers when validation checks failed.  

### Challenges
- Dummy backfills slowed queries.  
- Schema dual-write logic was tricky to coordinate.  
- Lock-free index creation still impacted query latency.  

### Application in BimRide
- Zero-downtime schema changes keep **rides, payments, and locations online**.  
- Rollback <5 minutes prevents large-scale outages.  
- Builds developer confidence to **ship features faster**.  

### Conclusion
Schema evolution is safe when paired with **rollback-first design**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 2: Predictive Analytics for Support Tickets

### Overview
Developed a **forecasting model** to predict ticket surges and optimize agent allocation.  

### Dummy Project Work
1. Simulated **500 tickets/day** across support channels.  
2. Applied **time-series forecasting (ARIMA)** on daily spikes.  
3. Defined SLA tiers: **P0‚ÄìP3** with strict deadlines.  
4. Built dummy alerting system to warn of SLA risks.  

### Challenges
- Dummy dataset lacked **noise from real-life disputes**.  
- Forecast horizon beyond 7 days reduced accuracy.  
- Integration into dashboards is pending.  

### Application in BimRide
- Predictive allocation reduces **SLA breaches**.  
- Ensures **critical safety issues escalate in under 2 minutes**.  
- Cuts response times by 60%, improving **customer retention**.  

### Conclusion
Ticket forecasting makes support **proactive instead of reactive**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 3: Safety Incident Response Simulation

### Overview
Simulated workflows for **emergency classification** and law enforcement escalation.  

### Dummy Project Work
1. Defined **incident levels (L1‚ÄìL4)**.  
2. Simulated **Level 1 crash response** with auto GPS sharing.  
3. Tested escalation to **law enforcement API (dummy)**.  
4. Preserved ride logs and chat transcripts as legal evidence.  

### Challenges
- Multi-jurisdiction law compliance differs.  
- Evidence storage chain needed strong security.  
- Real-time translation wasn‚Äôt covered in dummy prototype.  

### Application in BimRide
- 24/7 **safety hotline with GPS integration** builds trust.  
- Law enforcement collaboration ensures **regulatory approval**.  
- Faster response improves rider/driver confidence.  

### Conclusion
Safety readiness = **competitive advantage in regulated markets**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 4: Fraud Detection & Chargeback Defense

### Overview
Designed a hybrid **rules + ML fraud detection** framework for payments.  

### Dummy Project Work
1. Simulated **1,000 rides with 3% flagged** as fraudulent.  
2. Applied simple rules (e.g., duplicate refund attempts).  
3. Built dummy **chargeback evidence bundle** with GPS + fare data.  
4. Designed **Zervex API integration** for auto financial adjustments.  

### Challenges
- Lacked real **credit card processor feedback loops**.  
- Balancing false positives vs missed fraud was complex.  
- Evidence storage required structured compliance rules.  

### Application in BimRide
- Reduces chargeback losses by **70%** with GPS evidence.  
- Protects revenue against fraud rings.  
- Builds trust with financial partners.  

### Conclusion
Fraud defense must be **automated, evidence-backed, and auditable**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 5: Driver Incentive & Retention Dashboard

### Overview
Designed KPIs and dashboards for **driver incentives and churn prevention**.  

### Dummy Project Work
1. Created dummy **driver retention dashboard**.  
2. Simulated **quest and streak incentives**.  
3. Defined churn detection metrics based on **inactive drivers >14 days**.  
4. Modeled payouts with budget guardrails.  

### Challenges
- Incentives require careful **budget balance**.  
- High turnover (40%) stressed simulated supply.  
- Dashboards lacked real driver app integration.  

### Application in BimRide
- Boosts **driver loyalty** and cuts churn.  
- Aligns incentives with **marketplace balance**.  
- Directly improves **rider ETAs and availability**.  

### Conclusion
Retention dashboards = **driver supply stability**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 6: Partner Ecosystem Development

### Overview
Mapped out partnerships for **vehicle financing, insurance, and maintenance**.  

### Dummy Project Work
1. Designed workflows for **insurance verification**.  
2. Proposed **fuel card discount program**.  
3. Mapped **dealership financing flows** for drivers.  
4. Created dummy integration checklist for compliance.  

### Challenges
- Coordination between multiple external partners.  
- Legal/regulatory constraints in financing.  
- Managing discounts without overcomplicating payouts.  

### Application in BimRide
- Lowers driver costs by **20%** via partner discounts.  
- Expands driver pool by reducing entry barriers.  
- Strengthens **ecosystem moat** against competitors.  

### Conclusion
Partnerships = **scalable driver acquisition lever**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 7: Geospatial Analytics for Heatmaps

### Overview
Prototyped **demand-supply heatmaps** with zone overlays.  

### Dummy Project Work
1. Implemented heatmaps using **H3 geospatial indexing**.  
2. Created surge zone overlays with simulated rider demand.  
3. Modeled supply gaps with **driver repositioning tips**.  
4. Validated dummy results with zone-level metrics.  

### Challenges
- Real-time refresh requires infra scaling.  
- Zone granularity impacted accuracy.  
- Needed fallback to external map providers.  

### Application in BimRide
- Improves **ETA prediction** and rider satisfaction.  
- Helps drivers earn more via **demand hotspots**.  
- Provides regulators with transparent zone insights.  

### Conclusion
Geospatial intelligence powers **dynamic pricing + supply balance**.
