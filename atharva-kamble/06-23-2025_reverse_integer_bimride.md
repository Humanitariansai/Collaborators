# üß† Reverse Integer ‚Äì In-Depth Study Report

## üö© Problem Statement

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-2¬≥¬π, 2¬≥¬π - 1]`, return `0`.

## ‚úÖ Final Solution (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        INT_MIN, INT_MAX = -2**31, 2**31 - 1

        sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1
        x_abs = abs(x)
        reversed_num = 0

        while x_abs != 0:
            digit = x_abs % 10
            x_abs //= 10

            # Check for overflow before multiplying or adding
            if reversed_num > (INT_MAX - digit) // 10:
                return 0

            reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + digit

        return sign * reversed_num
```

## üß∞ Data Structure

### Integer Manipulation & Basic Arithmetic

- Uses **integer division** and **modulo** operations to extract and rebuild digits.
- No auxiliary data structures like lists or strings were used, keeping it memory-efficient.
- Overflow prevention logic is implemented using **mathematical boundary checks**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Metric | Value       |
|--------|-------------|
| Time   | O(log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄx)   |
| Space  | O(1)        |

- **Time**: Each digit of the input number is processed once.
- **Space**: Constant space used regardless of input size.

## üßº Clean Code Practices Applied

- **Clear variable naming**: `x_abs`, `reversed_num`, `digit`, `sign`
- **Edge case handling**: Checks for 32-bit overflow before constructing result
- **Compact logic**: Uses one loop with in-place manipulation
- **Comments**: Key operations (like overflow check) are clearly documented

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced and Learnings

### 1. Handling Negative Numbers
Instead of manipulating signs repeatedly, the solution simplifies by isolating the sign and working with the absolute value. This reduces branching errors.

### 2. Overflow Detection
One major pitfall is failing to detect when reversing will exceed the integer bounds. This was solved using a clever pre-check before each multiplication step.

### 3. Truncation vs Flooring
Using `//` instead of `/` avoids unexpected decimal values and helps maintain type consistency as integers.

### 4. Reconstructing Number
Understanding how to reverse a number using `%` and `//` operations was crucial. It also helped reinforce basic number theory concepts.

## üöó Relevance to BimRide and Ride-Hailing Applications

While reversing an integer may seem like a mathematical exercise, its underlying logic and practices are highly applicable in real-world scenarios like **BimRide**:

### 1. Trip ID or Booking Code Reversal/Validation
Systems often generate and decode identifiers. This technique can be used to reverse codes for temporary validation or debugging without storing extra metadata.

### 2. Digit-Based Fare or Distance Adjustment
Certain fare calculations might involve digit manipulation, especially in offline pricing engines or embedded systems used in low-data environments.

### 3. Platform-Agnostic Backend Design
Avoiding strings or collections in this solution mimics real-time embedded systems where space is constrained‚Äîsimilar to mobile ride-hailing environments with low memory.

### 4. Security and Encoding Layers
Reverse logic may also be useful in obfuscation algorithms for fare encryption, short-lived session tokens, or real-time tracking values.

## üîö Conclusion

The **Reverse Integer** problem is a simple but powerful demonstration of clean logic, constraint handling, and system safety (via overflow checks).

Its mathematical clarity, low-memory footprint, and defensive programming approach make it ideal for systems like **BimRide**, where performance, edge-case resilience, and compact logic are essential.

Understanding this logic forms a foundation for secure, predictable numeric processing in real-time, user-facing applications.
