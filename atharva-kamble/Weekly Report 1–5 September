## üìå Overview
This week‚Äôs work focused on **core backend reliability, customer/driver operations, safety protocols, financial dispute workflows, and partner ecosystem support**.  
Each project simulated practical implementations with dummy data and workflows to mirror **BimRide‚Äôs scaling challenges**.  

The overall goal was to design **robust infrastructure and operational systems** that reduce downtime, improve customer trust, and sustain driver supply.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 1: Safe Database Migrations & Rollbacks

### Overview
The project examined strategies for **online schema changes** with **zero downtime** and **rollback safety nets**.

### Dummy Project Work
1. Created a dummy **`users` table** with historical ride data.  
2. Designed a migration to split profile details into a new **`user_profiles`** table.  
3. Simulated **expand ‚Üí migrate ‚Üí contract** workflow with checkpoints.  
4. Tested rollback by toggling a **feature flag** to revert reads back to the old table.  

### Challenges
- Simulating **large table backfills** slowed queries.  
- Risk of **foreign key locks** even on dummy data.  
- Testing dual-writes required careful sequencing.  

### Application in BimRide
- Enables **24/7 schema updates** without breaking trips or payments.  
- Reduces downtime risk during **global rollouts**.  
- Provides **rollback in <5 minutes** if migration fails.  

### Conclusion
Database resilience is foundational. The dummy work proved **expand/contract with feature flag gating** is the safest path forward.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 2: Customer Support Ticketing & Case Management

### Overview
Designed a **support ticketing prototype** with **priority routing and SLA tracking**.

### Dummy Project Work
1. Simulated **500 tickets/day** split across channels (in-app, email, phone).  
2. Built dummy **priority tiers (P0‚ÄìP3)** with SLA deadlines.  
3. Routed tickets with simple **keyword detection** (e.g., ‚Äúrefund‚Äù, ‚Äúsafety‚Äù).  
4. Integrated mock **knowledge base search** for agents.  

### Challenges
- Balancing **agent workloads** across queues.  
- Simulating **multi-party disputes** (driver + rider both reporting).  
- Tracking **SLA breaches** required live dashboards.  

### Application in BimRide
- Cuts **response time** from hours to minutes.  
- Increases **CSAT scores** via consistent workflows.  
- Creates a **single case history** across channels.  

### Conclusion
Automated routing + unified dashboards can **reduce resolution time by 60%**, a key metric for customer retention.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 3: Safety Incident Response & Crisis Management

### Overview
Prototyped a **4-level incident classification system** for emergencies and safety-related events.

### Dummy Project Work
1. Defined **incident levels** (Life-threatening ‚Üí General safety inquiry).  
2. Simulated **Level 1: vehicle crash** with GPS + auto-dial integration.  
3. Tested dummy **law enforcement API call** for location handoff.  
4. Preserved dummy **ride logs + chat transcripts** for evidence.  

### Challenges
- Multi-jurisdiction compliance (different response protocols).  
- Preserving **digital evidence chain**.  
- Managing **real-time communication** in multi-language scenarios.  

### Application in BimRide
- Under 2-minute response for **critical emergencies**.  
- Builds trust with regulators through **documented escalation protocols**.  
- Protects BimRide‚Äôs **brand reputation** in crises.  

### Conclusion
Crisis readiness = business resilience. Dummy runs show automation + evidence preservation are non-negotiable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 4: Payment Disputes & Financial Resolution

### Overview
Simulated workflows for **refunds, fare disputes, chargebacks, and driver earnings conflicts**.

### Dummy Project Work
1. Created dummy dataset of **1,000 rides** with 5% disputed.  
2. Split into **automatic refunds**, **standard reviews**, and **complex disputes**.  
3. Simulated a **chargeback case** with compiled GPS + fare evidence.  
4. Built simple **fraud detection rules** (e.g., repeated refund claims).  

### Challenges
- Handling **surge pricing disputes** (fairness perception).  
- Chargeback losses > transaction amount in some cases.  
- Simulating **driver payout corrections** without live payroll system.  

### Application in BimRide
- Automated workflows resolve **60% of cases in <2 hours**.  
- GPS-based evidence cuts chargeback losses by **70%**.  
- Driver payout errors fixed in <24 hours improve retention.  

### Conclusion
Strong dispute resolution systems protect **both revenue and trust**. Dummy work highlights automation + evidence as key levers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 5: Driver Relations & Partner Support

### Overview
Explored systems to **reduce driver churn** and build a **partner ecosystem** for compliance, earnings, and retention.

### Dummy Project Work
1. Simulated onboarding workflow with **document verification + vehicle checks**.  
2. Created dummy **driver incentive dashboard** (earnings optimization tips).  
3. Modeled **driver retention program** with referral + milestone bonuses.  
4. Mapped partner ecosystem: **dealerships, insurance, fuel cards**.  

### Challenges
- High **turnover (40%)** simulated in dataset.  
- Compliance delays added 5‚Äì7 days before drivers go live.  
- Retention incentives needed careful **budget guardrails**.  

### Application in BimRide
- Onboarding cut from 7 days ‚Üí **3 days** with mobile inspections.  
- Retention improved via **bonuses + recognition programs**.  
- Partner discounts reduce driver costs by **20%**.  

### Conclusion
Driver relations = supply stability. Investing in retention + partnerships directly impacts **availability and growth**.
