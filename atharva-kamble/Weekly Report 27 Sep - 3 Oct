## üõ†Ô∏è Day 1: Understanding Driver Inactivity Patterns  

### Overview  
Explored the main factors contributing to driver inactivity and assessed potential solutions for improving engagement.  

### Work Done  
1. Analyzed driver login data and session frequency from earlier datasets.  
2. Identified drop-off trends after high-demand days and late-night shifts.  
3. Grouped drivers by average ride completion rate and active hours.  
4. Drafted early ideas for engagement prompts and retention nudges.  

### Challenges  
- Data availability limited longer historical comparison.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Insights will support **automated engagement reminders** for inactive drivers.  
- Builds the foundation for **behavior-based incentive models**.  

### Conclusion  
Driver retention strengthens overall **supply consistency and service reliability**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 2: Early Testing of Driver Retention Models  

### Overview  
Built upon the inactivity analysis by running basic tests on engagement clusters and incentive response trends.  

### Work Done  
1. Created sample groups for ‚Äúactive,‚Äù ‚Äúoccasional,‚Äù and ‚Äúreturning‚Äù drivers.  
2. Simulated retention messages triggered by inactivity over 7 days.  
3. Tracked mock driver reactivation rates for pattern recognition.  
4. Outlined key metrics for evaluating incentive success.  

### Challenges  
- Simulated engagement lacks real-time driver feedback.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Lays groundwork for **A/B testing retention campaigns**.  
- Encourages **data-driven incentive targeting** instead of blanket rewards.  

### Conclusion  
Targeted motivation mechanisms yield higher engagement over generic bonuses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 3: Refining Support Request Forecasting  

### Overview  
Enhanced forecasting accuracy for support requests by introducing additional influencing variables.  

### Work Done  
1. Included external variables like time of day, surge activity, and rain data.  
2. Tested multiple moving-average intervals to smooth out spikes.  
3. Compared performance against last week‚Äôs ARIMA baseline.  
4. Visualized prediction output using trend plots for clearer interpretation.  

### Challenges  
- Irregular timestamp data introduced small deviations in results.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Enables **better staffing allocation** during high-demand periods.  
- Helps ensure **service level consistency** under varying conditions.  

### Conclusion  
Better data inputs lead to **more accurate operational forecasts**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 4: Forecast Model Validation  

### Overview  
Reviewed and validated forecasting outcomes by comparing against past event data.  

### Work Done  
1. Cross-checked predictions against simulated historical spikes.  
2. Measured variance between predicted and actual support load.  
3. Adjusted weighting parameters to reduce prediction error.  
4. Documented model reliability for internal review.  

### Challenges  
- Inconsistent event tagging reduced precision for certain periods.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Provides foundation for **predictive alert systems** within the support dashboard.  
- Builds trust in **data-backed decision-making** for team scheduling.  

### Conclusion  
Validation confirms predictive analytics as a **scalable operational tool**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 5: Fair Pricing Framework Research  

### Overview  
Investigated industry-standard pricing strategies and benchmarked how other ride-hailing platforms manage fare balance.  

### Work Done  
1. Compared competitor surge pricing methods and commission structures.  
2. Mapped out trip distance vs fare ratio for equity analysis.  
3. Reviewed rider sentiment around price volatility during demand surges.  
4. Drafted a flexible base fare formula for BimRide‚Äôs future pricing tests.  

### Challenges  
- Limited access to verified external pricing datasets.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Guides **transparent fare policies** and driver payout models.  
- Promotes **long-term user trust** through fair cost distribution.  

### Conclusion  
Balanced pricing fosters **mutual benefit and sustainable marketplace growth**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 6: Competitive Pricing Model Evaluation  

### Overview  
Expanded on previous findings to evaluate the relationship between pricing fairness and driver retention.  

### Work Done  
1. Compared simulated payout data between flat and surge-based models.  
2. Identified trade-offs between high-frequency short trips and long-distance fares.  
3. Evaluated driver earnings predictability under each model.  
4. Compiled pros and cons for internal pricing framework proposals.  

### Challenges  
- Comparative data lacked regional cost-of-living adjustments.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Strengthens pricing fairness by balancing **driver stability** with **rider affordability**.  
- Creates groundwork for future **pricing transparency dashboard**.  

### Conclusion  
Price fairness directly impacts **driver trust and user retention**.
