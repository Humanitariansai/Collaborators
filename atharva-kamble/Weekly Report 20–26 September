## üõ†Ô∏è Day 1: Driver Churn Research  

### Overview  
Explored why drivers stop using ride-hailing apps and what signals point toward churn.  

### Work Done  
1. Reviewed common churn signals: low earnings, skipped peak hours, reduced acceptance rate.  
2. Compared retention tactics used by Uber, Lyft, and Grab.  
3. Collected examples of bonus and streak systems tied to driver activity.  

### Challenges  
- Lack of access to real activity data makes validation difficult.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Creates a foundation for building churn alerts inside driver dashboards.  

### Conclusion  
Driver churn can be better understood by combining behavioral and earnings-related signals.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 2: Driver Incentive Studies  

### Overview  
Researched incentive and rewards structures used in global ride-hailing markets.  

### Work Done  
1. Studied milestone rewards vs flat bonuses.  
2. Looked at driver subscription models with lower commission fees.  
3. Documented ‚Äúquests‚Äù and ‚Äústreaks‚Äù from competitor apps.  

### Challenges  
- Balancing incentives with long-term cost control is tricky.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Provides a playbook of tested incentive models to experiment with in pilots.  

### Conclusion  
Well-structured incentives help boost loyalty but must remain cost-efficient.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 3: Support Ticket Forecasting Research  

### Overview  
Examined forecasting basics for predicting support spikes.  

### Work Done  
1. Reviewed ARIMA for ticket forecasting.  
2. Tested dummy surge-event ticket scenarios.  
3. Identified missing features like cancellations and refund triggers.  

### Challenges  
- Forecast accuracy dropped beyond one week.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Highlights the need to expand ticket forecasting with richer signals.  

### Conclusion  
Ticket forecasting can reduce SLA breaches if it uses more complete features.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 4: Alternative Forecasting Methods  

### Overview  
Researched models beyond ARIMA to handle ticket prediction.  

### Work Done  
1. Compared decision trees and gradient boosting with ARIMA.  
2. Reviewed LSTM examples in customer service datasets.  
3. Noted trade-offs between accuracy and computational needs.  

### Challenges  
- More advanced models require larger datasets to train effectively.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Creates a shortlist of models worth testing once ticket data is available.  

### Conclusion  
Forecasting may need a mix of classical and ML approaches for reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 5: Ride-Hailing Pricing Research  

### Overview  
Studied global pricing models and their impact on fairness and profitability.  

### Work Done  
1. Reviewed flat fares, surge-based pricing, and distance-based systems.  
2. Looked at subscription-style rider plans from competitors.  
3. Gathered rider feedback on pricing fairness and transparency.  

### Challenges  
- Pricing models differ widely by region, so testing is required for fit.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Provides starting options for experiments in local markets.  

### Conclusion  
Fair and transparent pricing strengthens both rider trust and driver earnings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 6: Growth-Tech Connection  

### Overview  
Linked research areas to BimRide‚Äôs growth and trust goals.  

### Work Done  
1. Outlined how churn, support, and pricing tie back to customer acquisition.  
2. Sketched a growth-tech bridge showing engineering‚Äôs role in SEO and ROI.  
3. Drafted notes for potential investor messaging.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Positions research as a driver of both **scaling stability and brand trust**.  

### Conclusion  
Technical research must always connect to growth outcomes.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Day 7: Weekly Wrap-Up  

### Overview  
Organized all findings and defined next-step experiments.  

### Work Done  
1. Consolidated churn, support, and pricing notes into a single brief.  
2. Flagged ideas that can be prototyped quickly (churn signals, ticket features).  
3. Marked pricing research for leadership review.  

### Application in BimRide  
- Provides a roadmap to transition from **research ‚Üí prototype** in the next sprint.  

### Conclusion  
Research created a clear base for action in the upcoming week.
