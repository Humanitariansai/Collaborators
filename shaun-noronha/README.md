# 🚗 BIMRIDE Workspace

============================================================

Welcome to my BIMRIDE workspace

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
Hi, I am **Shaun Noronha**. This workspace documents my work on the **BIMRIDE** project.  
My contributions span product research, data analysis, applied machine learning concepts, platform architecture exploration, and research driven experimentation.

Over time, my role evolved from hands on analysis and development to deeper research focused work, including evaluation of product strategy, SEO initiatives, backend analytics, and confidential proprietary datasets used to inform decision making.

## 💼 What This Repository Is For
This repository serves as a centralized record of my work on BIMRIDE.  
It includes weekly timesheets, research notes, technical explorations, analytical writeups, and structured progress reports.

All content is organized chronologically to ensure traceability, transparency, and ease of review.

## 🤝 Contribution
I am grateful to be part of this project and value collaboration, feedback, and shared learning.  
This repository reflects ongoing effort and continuous improvement.
