## 🌊 2025-09-19 – Coastal Flood-Aware Routing  
**Date:** 2025-09-19  
**Author:** Shaun Noronha  

### 🚀 Introduction  
Flooding near the **South Coast Boardwalk** and **Speightstown** after heavy rains can disrupt trips. We developed a **flood-aware routing engine** integrating hydrological data.  

### ⚙️ Architecture Overview  
```
[Rainfall Data] ---> [Flood Map API] ---> [Routing Engine] ---> [Driver Directions]
```

### 🧠 Algorithms Used  
```python
def reroute_if_flooded(route, flood_zones):
    for segment in route:
        if segment in flood_zones:
            return "Alternate path"
    return "Safe path"
```

### 🔁 MLOps Workflow Example  
```yaml
pipeline:
  - run: python fetch_rainfall.py
  - run: python update_flood_zones.py
  - run: python recompute_routes.py
```

### 🔍 Real-World Scenario  
After tropical showers in **Worthing Beach**, drivers were redirected inland through **Hastings Main Road**, ensuring uninterrupted service.
